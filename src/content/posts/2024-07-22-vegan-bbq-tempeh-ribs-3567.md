## Introduction

Tonight's dinner features a vegan take on the classic Southern BBQ ribs. Using tempeh as the base, this dish captures the smoky, savory flavors of traditional ribs without any meat. Paired with a homemade BBQ sauce that strikes the perfect balance between tangy and sweet, these vegan ribs are sure to be a hit at any dinner table.

## Ingredients

- 8 oz tempeh, sliced into rib-like strips
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon liquid smoke
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1/2 cup vegan BBQ sauce

## Instructions

1. Preheat your grill or oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. In a bowl, mix olive oil, soy sauce, liquid smoke, garlic powder, onion powder, and smoked paprika.
3. Brush the tempeh strips with the marinade, ensuring all sides are well coated.
4. Let the tempeh marinate for at least 30 minutes to absorb the flavors.
5. Place the marinated tempeh on the grill or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
6. Grill or bake for about 10 minutes on each side, or until the tempeh is crispy and golden.
7. In the last few minutes of cooking, brush the tempeh with vegan BBQ sauce and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes to caramelize the sauce.
8. Serve hot with extra BBQ sauce on the side for dipping.

Enjoy these delicious vegan BBQ tempeh ribs with a side of your favorite vegan coleslaw or potato salad for a complete meal that's both satisfying and plant-based.
