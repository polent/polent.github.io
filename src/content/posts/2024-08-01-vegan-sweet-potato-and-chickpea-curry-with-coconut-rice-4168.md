## Introduction

Today's lunch is a light yet nourishing dish inspired by the flavors of East Africa. Our Vegan Sweet Potato and Chickpea Curry, served with a side of fragrant coconut rice, is perfect for a mellow midday meal. This dish combines the sweetness of sweet potatoes with the rich, earthy flavors of chickpeas, all simmered in a coconut curry sauce spiced with traditional African herbs.

## Ingredients

- 2 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed
- 1 can (400 ml) chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- 1 can (400 ml) coconut milk
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp fresh ginger, grated
- 1 tbsp curry powder
- 1 tsp turmeric powder
- 1/2 tsp cumin seeds
- 1/2 tsp coriander powder
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 tbsp coconut oil
- Fresh cilantro, chopped (for garnish)
- 1 cup jasmine or basmati rice
- 1 3/4 cups water
- 1/2 cup coconut milk

## Instructions

1. Heat the coconut oil in a large pan over medium heat.
2. Add the cumin seeds and wait until they start to pop, then add onions, garlic, and ginger. Cook until the onions are soft and golden.
3. Stir in the curry powder, turmeric, and coriander powder, cooking for another minute until fragrant.
4. Add the sweet potatoes and chickpeas to the pan, stirring to coat them with the spices.
5. Pour in the coconut milk, season with salt and pepper, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for about 20 minutes, or until the sweet potatoes are tender.
6. While the curry cooks, prepare the coconut rice. Rinse the rice until the water runs clear. In a pot, bring water and coconut milk to a boil. Add the rice, reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for 18 minutes or until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed.
7. Serve the curry with the coconut rice, garnished with chopped cilantro.
