## Introduction

Today, we're diving into the heartwarming world of confit, traditionally a technique used to preserve meats, but here we're giving it a plant-based twist with an Asian flair. This Vegan Confit 'Duck' with Spicy Plum Sauce is a culinary bridge between tradition and innovation, perfect for a cozy evening or a special dinner.

## Ingredients

- 200g shredded jackfruit
- 3 tablespoons sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon Chinese five spice
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- 1 small piece of star anise
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 inch ginger, minced
- 200g plums, pitted and chopped
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon chili flakes
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 200°C (390°F).
2. In a bowl, mix shredded jackfruit with sesame oil, Chinese five spice, and a pinch of salt and pepper.
3. Spread the jackfruit on a baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes until tender.
4. In a saucepan, heat a tablespoon of sesame oil over medium heat. Add garlic and ginger, sauté until fragrant.
5. Add chopped plums, brown sugar, soy sauce, rice vinegar, star anise, and chili flakes to the pan. Simmer until the plums are soft and the sauce has thickened.
6. Remove the jackfruit from the oven and combine it with the spicy plum sauce. Mix well to ensure the jackfruit is evenly coated.
7. Serve hot and garnish with additional chili flakes if desired.

Enjoy this delightful fusion of flavors and textures that make every bite a celebration of culinary creativity. Serve this dish with a side of steamed rice or fresh greens for a complete meal.
