## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 300g chestnut mushrooms, sliced
- 150g walnuts, chopped
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tsp dried thyme
- 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- 100ml vegan red wine (optional)
- 200ml vegetable broth
- 2 tbsp cornstarch mixed with 2 tbsp water
- 1 vegan puff pastry sheet
- A handful of fresh parsley, chopped

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 200°C (390°F).
2. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic, sauté until translucent.
3. Add the mushrooms and cook until they start to release their juices.
4. Stir in the walnuts, soy sauce, thyme, paprika, salt, and pepper. Cook for another 5 minutes.
5. Pour in the wine if using, and let it reduce for a few minutes, then add the vegetable broth.
6. Add the cornstarch mixture to the skillet, stirring constantly until the sauce thickens.
7. Roll out the puff pastry and place the mushroom and walnut mixture in the center. Fold the edges over, leaving the center exposed.
8. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden and puffed.
9. Garnish with fresh parsley before serving.

Serve this delightful pie with a side of steamed green beans or a crisp salad for a complete meal that's not only satisfying but also packed with wholesome ingredients. It's a gourmet gastro pub experience right at your dining table!
