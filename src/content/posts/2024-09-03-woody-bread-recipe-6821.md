## Introduction

Today's woody bread recipe embraces the earthy flavors of autumn, combining the aromatic essence of rosemary with the robust taste of whole grains. This vegan bread is perfect for pairing with a hearty soup or a crisp salad.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups whole wheat flour
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon dried rosemary
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 2 teaspoons active dry yeast
- 1¼ cups warm water
- 2 tablespoons olive oil

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, combine both flours, dried rosemary, salt, and sugar. Mix well.
2. In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water and let it sit for about 5 minutes until frothy.
3. Add the yeast mixture and olive oil to the dry ingredients. Stir until the dough begins to form.
4. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes, until smooth and elastic.
5. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for 1 hour, or until doubled in size.
6. Punch down the dough and shape it into a loaf. Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
7. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Let the dough rest for another 30 minutes.
8. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the bread sounds hollow when tapped.
9. Remove from oven and let cool on a wire rack.

Enjoy this delightful woody bread fresh out of the oven, ideally while it's still warm and the aromas are at their peak. It's perfect for any meal where you want a touch of rustic charm and comforting flavors.
