  imageAlt: "Create an image of a tranquil breakfast table setting illuminated by soft morning sunlight, which is seeping softly through a nearby window. The table is adorned with a pristine white tablecloth. On an immaculate white plate, you can see two slices of whole grain bread toasted to a perfect golden brown, exuding warmth and a tantalizing aroma. A small bowl filled with a creamy green mash of ripe avocado is placed near the toast. On a separate plate, there are thin strips of firm tofu, seasoned lightly with lemon juice, salt, and pepper. The green shade of the avocado and the white tofu provide a visually pleasing contrast. Multiple toppings have been set up near the primary dish. These include sliced cherry tomatoes with their rich red tone, as well as sprouts and microgreens, which provide a pop of green color. Supplementing these are a light sprinkling of extra salt and pepper. The quiet elegance of the dish is the main focus, reflecting the allure of the avocado and tofu duo. The scene suggests a nutritious, satisfying, and visually striking beginning to the day, promising to titillate the senses with every morsel."
