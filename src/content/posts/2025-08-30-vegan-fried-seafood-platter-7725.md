## Introduction

Step into a culinary adventure with today's special vegan 'Fried' Seafood Platter. This delightful dish mirrors the traditional flavors of a seafood feast, using plant-based ingredients that offer a crunchy, savory, and utterly satisfying experience.

## Ingredients

- Hearts of palm (cut into pieces resembling calamari rings)
- King oyster mushrooms (shredded to mimic fish fillets)
- Nori sheets (torn into pieces, for wrapping around 'fish' to add a seafood flavor)
- Chickpea flour
- Sparkling water
- Kelp powder
- Garlic powder
- Paprika
- Salt
- Black pepper
- Olive oil (for frying)
- Lemon wedges (for serving)
- Tartar sauce (vegan)

## Instructions

1. Prepare the 'seafood': Wrap hearts of palm and shredded king oyster mushrooms with pieces of nori.
2. Make the batter: In a bowl, mix chickpea flour, sparkling water, kelp powder, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper to form a smooth, slightly thick batter.
3. Heat olive oil in a frying pan over medium heat.
4. Dip each piece of prepared 'seafood' into the batter, ensuring it's well-coated.
5. Fry in hot oil until golden and crispy, about 2-3 minutes on each side.
6. Drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.
7. Serve hot with lemon wedges and vegan tartar sauce.

Enjoy this innovative, vegan take on a classic fried seafood platter. Bursting with flavors and textures, it's perfect for sharing with friends and family or savoring solo on a cozy night in.
