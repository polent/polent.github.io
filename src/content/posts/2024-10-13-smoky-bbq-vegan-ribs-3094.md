## Introduction

Today's recipe is a delightful twist on the classic BBQ experience, perfect for a chewy, satisfying vegan lunch. We'll be making Smoky BBQ Vegan Ribs using king oyster mushrooms as the base. These ribs are marinated in a rich, homemade BBQ sauce and grilled to achieve a perfect char, offering a meaty texture and a burst of flavors.

## Ingredients

- 4 large king oyster mushrooms, sliced into "ribs"
- 1 cup homemade BBQ sauce
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon smoked paprika
- 2 teaspoons garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

## Instructions

1. Preheat your grill or grilling pan over medium heat.
2. In a small bowl, mix the smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper.
3. Brush each mushroom slice with olive oil and then rub the spice mix over each piece.
4. Grill the mushroom slices for about 3-4 minutes on each side, until they are nicely charred and tender.
5. Brush the BBQ sauce over the grilled mushrooms and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes on each side to caramelize the sauce.
6. Remove from the grill and let rest for a few minutes.
7. Serve hot, garnished with fresh parsley.

Enjoy your homemade Smoky BBQ Vegan Ribs with a side of creamy vegan coleslaw or a fresh green salad. This dish is sure to impress both vegans and meat-lovers alike, bringing the spirit of American BBQ to everyone's table without any animal products.
