## Introduction

Today's special is a Roasted Vegetable and Lentil Soup that embodies the warmth and comfort needed on any chilly day. This dish combines the earthy tones of roasted vegetables with the hearty texture of lentils, offering a delightfully nourishing experience.

## Ingredients

- 2 carrots, peeled and diced
- 1 large sweet potato, peeled and cubed
- 1 red bell pepper, chopped
- 1 yellow onion, chopped
- 3 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 cup of red lentils
- 4 cups of vegetable broth
- 1 teaspoon of smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon of cumin
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons of olive oil
- Fresh cilantro for garnish

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
2. Toss the carrots, sweet potato, bell pepper, and onion with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Spread on a baking sheet.
3. Roast in the oven for 25-30 minutes until vegetables are tender and slightly caramelized.
4. In a large pot, heat a splash of olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté until fragrant.
