## Introduction

Today, let's dive into a dish that embodies the warmth and richness of African cuisine with a vegan twist. This Vegan African Sweet Potato and Peanut Stew is not only comforting but also packed with flavors that will transport your palate to the heart of Africa.

## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon fresh ginger, grated
- 1 tablespoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (adjust according to taste)
- 4 large sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed
- 4 cups vegetable broth
- 1 can (14 oz) diced tomatoes
- 1 cup natural peanut butter
- 2 teaspoons salt
- Fresh cilantro, chopped (for garnish)
- Roasted peanuts, for topping

## Instructions

1. Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, and cook until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
2. Stir in the minced garlic, grated ginger, cumin, coriander, and cayenne pepper. Cook for another 2 minutes until fragrant.
3. Add the cubed sweet potatoes to the pot, stirring to coat them with the spices.
4. Pour in the vegetable broth and diced tomatoes. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for about 20 minutes, or until the sweet potatoes are tender.
5. Stir in the peanut butter and salt, and continue to cook for another 10 minutes on low heat, stirring occasionally.
6. Once the stew is thick and the sweet potatoes are soft, remove from heat. Serve hot, garnished with chopped cilantro and a sprinkle of roasted peanuts.

Serve this hearty stew warm, perhaps with a side of fresh bread or steamed rice, to soak up all the delicious flavors. It's perfect for a cozy night in or a special gathering with loved ones.
