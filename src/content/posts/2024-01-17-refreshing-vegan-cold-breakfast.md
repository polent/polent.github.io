At the bottom, we see mashed bananas and crunchy rolled oats. Followed by a layer of colorful mixed berries - strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries - peeking out. Next, the thick creaminess of plant-based yogurt is seen, its pure white color contrasting with the bright berries. A sprinkle of nutritious chia seeds is right on top. Covering all, there's a golden drizzle of maple syrup and a scattering of crushed nuts for a crunchy surprise. A few fresh mint leaves garnish this dish, adding a burst of green to the vibrant colors. This serves as a depiction of a healthful, energy-boosting breakfast, offering the perfect balance of nutrients and natural flavors."
