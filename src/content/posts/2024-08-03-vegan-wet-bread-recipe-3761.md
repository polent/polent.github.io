## Introduction

Today, let's explore a vegan twist on the classic 'wet bread' dish, transforming it into a delightful, savory treat. This vegan Wet Bread incorporates a rich, tomato-based sauce and a variety of herbs, soaked into crusty bread for a unique and satisfying experience.

## Ingredients

- 1 loaf of crusty vegan bread (sourdough or ciabatta works well)
- 2 cups of crushed tomatoes
- 1 onion, finely diced
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1/2 cup of fresh basil, chopped
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1 tsp dried thyme
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1/2 cup of vegetable broth
- Optional: Nutritional yeast or vegan parmesan for topping

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. In a skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onion and minced garlic, sautéing until the onion becomes translucent.
3. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, vegetable broth, oregano, thyme, and basil. Season with salt and pepper. Let it simmer for about 10 minutes until it thickens slightly.
4. Slice the bread into thick pieces and arrange them in a deep baking dish.
5. Pour the tomato mixture evenly over the bread, ensuring each piece is well-coated.
6. Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.
7. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes or until the top is slightly crispy.
8. Optional: Sprinkle nutritional yeast or vegan parmesan on top before serving.

Enjoy this comforting and hearty dish as a main course or a side. It’s perfect for a cozy night in or a gathering with friends who enjoy a plant-based diet!
