## Introduction

Tonight's dinner brings a flaky delight to your table with our Vegan African-Inspired Flaky Pockets, filled with spicy lentils and vegetables. This dish is a perfect blend of hearty fillings encased in a crispy, golden pastry, ideal for a cozy evening meal.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup red lentils
- 2 cups vegetable broth
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 carrot, diced
- 1 bell pepper, diced
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1/2 tsp turmeric
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 1 package vegan puff pastry, thawed
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 2 tbsp fresh cilantro, chopped

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. In a medium saucepan, bring the vegetable broth to a boil and add the red lentils. Cook until lentils are tender, about 15 minutes.
3. In a skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, carrot, and bell pepper. Sauté until vegetables are softened.
4. Stir in cooked lentils, cumin, paprika, turmeric, salt, and pepper. Cook for an additional 5 minutes.
5. Roll out the puff pastry and cut into squares. Spoon the lentil mixture onto the center of each square.
6. Fold the pastry over the filling to create a triangle shape and press the edges with a fork to seal.
7. Place the pockets on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until golden and flaky.
8. Garnish with fresh cilantro before serving.

Serve these warm, flaky pockets fresh out of the oven with a side of tangy chutney or a cooling vegan yogurt dip for a satisfying, delicious meal that's sure to impress.
