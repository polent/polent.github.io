## Introduction

Tonight, let's indulge in a hearty and comforting classic with a vegan twist: Vegan Shepherd's Pie. This dish packs all the traditional flavors with layers of savory lentils, vegetables, and a creamy mashed potato topping.

## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 carrots, diced
- 2 celery stalks, diced
- 1 cup mushrooms, chopped
- 1 cup green peas
- 1 cup corn kernels
- 1 1/2 cups cooked lentils
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 cup vegetable broth
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 4 large potatoes, peeled and chopped
- 1/4 cup vegan butter
- 1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk
- Salt to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).
2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic, cooking until soft.
3. Add carrots, celery, and mushrooms to the skillet and cook until they are softened, about 5 minutes.
4. Stir in green peas, corn, and cooked lentils.
5. Mix in tomato paste, dried thyme, and soy sauce. Add vegetable broth, bring to a simmer, and let cook for another 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
6. Meanwhile, boil potatoes in a pot of salted water until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and return to the pot.
7. Add vegan butter and almond milk to the potatoes and mash until smooth. Season with salt.
8. Transfer the vegetable and lentil mixture to a baking dish. Spread the mashed potatoes on top, smoothing with a spoon or spatula.
9. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes or until the mashed potatoes are slightly golden.
10. Broil for the last 2-3 minutes to get a crispy top, if desired.

Serve this delightful Vegan Shepherd's Pie hot, and watch it become the centerpiece of your dinner table. It's perfect for warming up on a chilly evening with family or impressing guests with your vegan culinary skills!
