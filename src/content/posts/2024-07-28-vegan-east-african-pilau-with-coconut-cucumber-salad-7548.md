## Introduction

Today's robust lunch features a vegan twist on the classic East African Pilau, accompanied by a refreshing Coconut Cucumber Salad. This dish perfectly balances rich, spiced flavors with a cool, crisp salad for a satisfying midday meal.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup basmati rice, rinsed and drained
- 2 tablespoons coconut oil
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon ginger, grated
- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 4 cardamom pods, crushed
- 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
- 2 cups vegetable broth
- Salt to taste
- 2 tablespoons fresh cilantro, chopped
- 1 cucumber, thinly sliced
- 1/2 cup coconut yogurt
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon mint, chopped
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

- Heat the coconut oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, and ginger, and saut√© until the onions are translucent.
- Stir in the cumin seeds, cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, turmeric, and cloves. Cook for about 2 minutes until fragrant.
- Add the rinsed basmati rice to the pot and stir well to coat with the spices.
- Pour in the vegetable broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 18-20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and all the liquid is absorbed.
- While the rice cooks, prepare the salad by combining the sliced cucumber, coconut yogurt, lemon juice, and mint in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

- Serve the pilau hot with the coconut cucumber salad on the side.

Enjoy this hearty, flavorful meal that brings a piece of East Africa to your table. Perfect for a fulfilling lunch, it's sure to delight your taste buds and keep you energized throughout the day.
