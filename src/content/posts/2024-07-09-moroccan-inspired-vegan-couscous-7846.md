## Ingredients

- 1 cup couscous (whole wheat for added nutrition)

- 1 red bell pepper, chopped 
- 1 yellow bell pepper, chopped 
- 1 small red onion, chopped 
- 3 cloves garlic, minced 
- 1 cup chickpeas, drained and rinsed

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). 
2. In a large bowl, toss zucchini, red and yellow bell peppers, red onion, and garlic with olive oil, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, ginger, and cayenne pepper. Season with salt and pepper. 
3. Spread the vegetables on a baking sheet in a single layer. Roast in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes or until vegetables are tender and slightly caramelized.
