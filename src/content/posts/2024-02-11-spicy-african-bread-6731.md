## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, salt, paprika, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, dried thyme, ground black pepper, ground coriander, ground cumin, ground turmeric, ground ginger, and ground cinnamon.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the vegetable oil, non-dairy milk, apple cider vinegar, and maple syrup.

5. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead it gently for a few minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.
6. Shape the dough into a round loaf and place it on the prepared baking sheet.
7. Use a sharp knife to score the top of the loaf in a cross pattern.
8. Bake the bread in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
