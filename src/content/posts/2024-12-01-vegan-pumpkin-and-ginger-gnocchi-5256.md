## Ingredients

- 2 cups pumpkin puree
- 1 tbsp fresh ginger, finely grated
- 2 cups all-purpose flour (gluten-free if needed)
- 1 tsp sea salt
- 1/4 cup nutritional yeast
- 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg
- Fresh Thai basil leaves, for garnish
- Extra virgin olive oil, for drizzling

## Instructions

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the pumpkin puree and grated ginger.
