## Introduction

Dive into the robust flavors of vegan BBQ with this Smoky Vegan Pulled Jackfruit Sandwich. Perfect for a hearty and satisfying lunch, this dish captures the essence of traditional BBQ while being completely plant-based.

## Ingredients

- 2 cans of young green jackfruit in water or brine, drained and rinsed
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 small onion, finely chopped

- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon chili powder
- 1 cup vegan BBQ sauce
- 4 vegan burger buns

## Instructions

1. Preheat a large pan over medium heat and add olive oil.
2. Saut√© onion and garlic until they become soft and translucent.
3. Shred the jackfruit with your hands or a fork, then add to the pan with the onions and garlic.
