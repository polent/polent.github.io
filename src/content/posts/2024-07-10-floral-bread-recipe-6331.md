## Introduction

Today's recipe is a delightful floral bread that not only looks beautiful but also brings a subtle hint of nature's aromas to your palate. Perfect for a special brunch or a serene afternoon tea, this bread combines the earthy flavors of herbs with the delicate essence of edible flowers.

## Ingredients

- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 packet active dry yeast (about 2 1/4 teaspoons)
- 1 cup warm water
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/4 cup mixed edible flowers (such as marigolds, violets, and rose petals)
- 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon fresh thyme, finely chopped

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it sit until frothy, about 5 minutes.
2. Add the flour, salt, and olive oil to the yeast mixture. Mix until a soft dough forms.
3. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes, until smooth and elastic.
4. Gently fold in the edible flowers and herbs until evenly distributed.
5. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a cloth, and let it rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
6. Punch down the dough and shape it into a loaf. Place it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
7. Cover the loaf and let it rise again for about 30 minutes.
8. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
9. Bake the bread for 25-30 minutes, or until golden brown and the loaf sounds hollow when tapped.
10. Remove from the oven and let cool on a wire rack before slicing.

Enjoy this beautiful floral bread as a centerpiece on your dining table or as a thoughtful gift. Its unique flavors and charming appearance are sure to impress!
