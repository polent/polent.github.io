## Introduction

Today's fresh bread recipe is a vegan, nutrient-packed loaf made with a combination of whole wheat and chickpea flour. This bread is perfect for anyone looking to add a rustic, hearty touch to their meal.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups whole wheat flour
- 1 cup chickpea flour
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 packet (about 2¼ teaspoons) active dry yeast
- 1¼ cups warm water
- 2 tablespoons olive oil

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, combine the whole wheat flour, chickpea flour, sugar, and salt.
2. In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water and let it sit until frothy, about 10 minutes.
3. Add the yeast mixture and olive oil to the dry ingredients and mix until a dough forms.
4. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.
5. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for 1 hour or until doubled in size.
6. Punch down the dough, shape it into a loaf, and place it in a greased loaf pan.
7. Cover and let rise for another 30 minutes.
8. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
9. Bake the bread for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden and the loaf sounds hollow when tapped.
10. Remove from the oven and let cool on a wire rack before slicing.

Enjoy this delicious, freshly baked vegan bread with your meals, or simply spread some vegan butter on a warm slice for a comforting snack. It's a versatile addition to any vegan diet.
