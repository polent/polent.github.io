## Introduction

Embrace the bold and vibrant flavors of today's gastro pub fare with this vegan Peppery Mushroom and Ale Pie. A hearty, satisfying dish that combines the umami richness of mushrooms with the deep, aromatic notes of ale, all encased in a flaky, golden crust. This recipe is perfect for those chilly evenings when comfort food is just what you need.

## Ingredients

* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 large onion, finely chopped
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 500g mixed mushrooms, roughly chopped
* 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
* 1 tablespoon soy sauce
* 1 cup vegan ale (ensure it's vegan as some beers use animal products in processing)
* 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 1 sheet vegan puff pastry
* Salt to taste
* Fresh parsley, chopped for garnish

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 200°C (390°F).
2. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic, sautéing until soft and translucent.
3. Add the chopped mushrooms and cook until they begin to release their juices.
4. Stir in the smoked paprika and soy sauce, cooking for another minute.
5. Pour in the vegan ale and bring to a simmer, allowing the mixture to reduce slightly.
6. Sprinkle the flour over the mixture, stirring well to incorporate and thicken the sauce. Season with black pepper and salt to taste.
7. Transfer the mushroom and ale filling to a pie dish.
8. Cover the filling with the puff pastry, trimming any excess and crimp the edges to seal.
9. Make a few slits in the pastry to allow steam to escape during baking.
10. Bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes or until the pastry is puffed and golden brown.
11. Garnish with fresh parsley before serving.

Serve this Peppery Mushroom and Ale Pie with a side of steamed green beans or a crisp salad for a complete meal. It's sure to be a hit with both vegans and non-vegans alike, making it a perfect addition to your culinary repertoire.
