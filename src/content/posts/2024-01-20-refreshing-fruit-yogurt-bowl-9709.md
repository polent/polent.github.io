In the middle, there's a bowl filled with a mound of creamy plant-based yogurt, topped with sliced bananas, vibrant strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries arranged artistically in the yogurt. Over these colorful fruits, there's a generous sprinkle of homemade granola, made of toasted oats, nuts, and seeds. Sprinkled as garnishing are miniature black speckles of chia seeds, with a few fresh mint leaves on top, exuding a refreshing aroma. The table setting is completed by the surrounding scenery of lush, verdant greenery and blooming flowers."
