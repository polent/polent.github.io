## Introduction

Welcome to a brunch experience like no other, where the essence of charred, smoky flavors meets the vibrancy of plant-based ingredients. This recipe for Charred Vegan Shakshuka is not just a meal; it's a celebration of textures and tastes that will elevate your morning.

## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 large red bell pepper, sliced
- 1 large yellow bell pepper, sliced
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon chili powder
- 1 can (400g) crushed tomatoes
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 1 block (200g) firm tofu, crumbled
- Fresh cilantro, for garnish
- Optional: Sliced avocado and fresh lime wedges, for serving

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
2. Add the sliced bell peppers and onion, saut√©ing until they begin to char and soften, about 5-7 minutes.
3. Stir in the garlic, smoked paprika, cumin, and chili powder, cooking until fragrant, about 1 minute.
4. Pour in the crushed tomatoes and tomato paste. Season with salt and pepper. Simmer the sauce for 10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.
5. Gently fold in the crumbled tofu, simulating the chunks of egg typically found in shakshuka. Allow it to heat through and absorb the flavors, about 5 minutes.
6. Garnish with fresh cilantro, and serve hot. Add avocado slices and a squeeze of lime if desired.

Serve this delightful Charred Vegan Shakshuka with freshly baked sourdough or flatbread for a complete brunch experience. Enjoy the blend of spices, the richness of the sauce, and the heartiness of the tofu - a perfect start to your day!
