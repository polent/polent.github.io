## Introduction

Indulge in these Vegan BBQ Pulled Jackfruit Sliders, a perfect gooey finger food for any gathering. This recipe captures the essence of traditional BBQ while staying completely plant-based.

## Ingredients

- 2 cans of young green jackfruit in water or brine, drained and rinsed
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1/2 tsp ground cumin
- 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (optional)
- Salt and black pepper, to taste
- 1 cup vegan BBQ sauce
- 12 small slider buns, toasted
- Vegan coleslaw (optional) for topping

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).
2. Shred the jackfruit with a fork or your fingers until it resembles pulled pork.
3. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic, sautéing until the onion becomes translucent.
4. Add the shredded jackfruit, smoked paprika, cumin, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper to the skillet. Stir well to combine.
5. Cook for about 5 minutes, until the jackfruit is well seasoned and slightly browned.
6. Add the vegan BBQ sauce to the skillet, stir to coat the jackfruit evenly. Reduce the heat and simmer for about 10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.
7. Spread the BBQ jackfruit mixture onto the toasted slider buns. Top with vegan coleslaw if desired.
8. Serve warm and enjoy!

Serve these delicious sliders at your next party or gathering and watch them disappear! They're sure to be a hit with vegans and non-vegans alike.
