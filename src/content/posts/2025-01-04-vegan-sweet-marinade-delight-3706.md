## Ingredients

- 1 cup sweet chili sauce
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons maple syrup
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon ginger, grated
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1 block of firm tofu, pressed and cubed
- 1 red bell pepper, sliced
- 1 green bell pepper, sliced
- 1 yellow onion, chopped
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- 2 tablespoons water
- Fresh cilantro, for garnish

## Instructions

1. In a bowl, combine sweet chili sauce, soy sauce, maple syrup, garlic, ginger, and sesame oil to create the marinade.
2. Add the cubed tofu to the marinade and let sit for at least 30 minutes, or overnight for deeper flavor.
3. Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat and saut√© the marinated tofu until golden brown. Remove and set aside.
4. In the same pan, add the bell peppers and onion, and stir-fry until they are just tender.
5. Return the tofu to the pan with the vegetables. Mix cornstarch and water to make a slurry and add to the pan to thicken the sauce.
6. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes or until the sauce is glossy and slightly thickened.
7. Garnish with fresh cilantro before serving.

Serve this exquisite dish warm, garnished with fresh herbs for an extra touch of color and flavor. It's not just a meal; it's an experience that celebrates the fusion of different culinary traditions with every bite.
