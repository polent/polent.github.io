## Ingredients

- 1 can (20 oz) young green jackfruit in brine, drained and shredded
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp ground cumin
- 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (optional)
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- 1/2 cup vegan BBQ sauce
- 12 mini corn tortillas

## Instructions

1. Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat.
2. Add the shredded jackfruit, smoked paprika, garlic powder, cumin, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper. Cook for 5-7 minutes until the jackfruit is lightly browned.
3. Pour in the vegan BBQ sauce, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is absorbed and the mixture is flavorful.
4. Warm the mini tortillas in a separate skillet or in the microwave.
5. Assemble the tacos by spooning the BBQ jackfruit onto each tortilla. Top with diced red onion, chopped cilantro, and diced avocado.
6. Serve with lime wedges on the side for squeezing over the tacos.
