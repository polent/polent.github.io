## Introduction

Today, I am excited to share a delightful vegan side dish that perfectly complements any main course. This mild, yet flavorful, Roasted Cauliflower with a Nutty Gremolata is not only easy to prepare but also packs a nutritional punch.

## Ingredients

- 1 large head of cauliflower, cut into florets
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 1/4 cup chopped hazelnuts
- 1/4 cup chopped parsley
- Zest of 1 lemon
- 2 cloves garlic, minced

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F).
2. Toss cauliflower florets with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Spread on a baking sheet.
3. Roast in the oven for 25-30 minutes, or until golden and tender.
4. While the cauliflower is roasting, mix chopped hazelnuts, parsley, lemon zest, and minced garlic in a small bowl to make the gremolata.
5. Once the cauliflower is done, sprinkle the nutty gremolata over the hot cauliflower.
6. Serve immediately.

Serve this warm with a sprinkle of fresh herbs, and watch it become a new favorite at your dining table. Its simplicity and elegance are sure to impress.
