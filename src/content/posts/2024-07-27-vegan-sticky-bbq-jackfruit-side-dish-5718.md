## Introduction

Sweet and tangy with a hint of smokiness, this vegan sticky BBQ jackfruit is the perfect side dish to complement your plant-based barbecue spread. It's easy to prepare and guaranteed to impress both vegans and meat-eaters alike.

## Ingredients

- 2 cans of young green jackfruit in brine, drained and rinsed
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
- 1 cup vegan BBQ sauce
- 2 tablespoons maple syrup
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. Pull the jackfruit pieces apart with your fingers or a fork to mimic the texture of pulled pork.
3. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until translucent.
4. Add the minced garlic, smoked paprika, cumin, and cayenne pepper to the skillet, stirring frequently for about 1 minute until fragrant.
5. Stir in the pulled jackfruit, then add the vegan BBQ sauce, maple syrup, and apple cider vinegar. Mix well to combine all the ingredients.
6. Transfer the jackfruit mixture to a baking dish and spread it out evenly.
7. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the jackfruit is tender and the sauce has thickened.
8. Remove from oven and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve warm.

Serve this delectable sticky BBQ jackfruit alongside your favorite vegan BBQ main courses. It's perfect for piling high on sandwiches, topping off salads, or enjoying as a flavorful side.
