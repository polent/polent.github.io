## Introduction

Embrace the essence of today's unique style with this warm and comforting Vegan Wild Mushroom and Truffle Risotto. Perfect for a cozy lunch, this dish combines earthy mushrooms, aromatic truffle, and velvety risotto rice to deliver a luxurious taste of the forest.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup Arborio rice
- 3 cups vegetable broth, warmed
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 300 g mixed wild mushrooms, sliced
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1/4 cup white wine (optional)
- 3 tbsp nutritional yeast
- 1 tbsp truffle oil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

## Instructions

1. Heat the olive oil in a large pan over medium heat.
2. Add the chopped onion and garlic, saut√©ing until translucent.
3. Increase the heat to medium-high and add the mushrooms, cooking until they are golden brown.
4. Stir in the Arborio rice, ensuring the grains get well-coated with the oil and take on a light golden color.
5. Deglaze the pan with white wine if using, allowing the alcohol to evaporate.
6. Gradually add the warm vegetable broth, one ladle at a time, stirring continuously until each ladleful is absorbed before adding the next.
7. Once the rice is tender and creamy, remove from heat and stir in the nutritional yeast and truffle oil. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.
