## Introduction

Today's woody salad is a unique blend of earthy flavors and hearty textures, perfect for a wholesome meal. Featuring wild rice, roasted mushrooms, and crunchy walnuts, this salad is a delightful celebration of natural, woodsy ingredients, all tied together with a tangy balsamic vinaigrette.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup wild rice
- 2 cups water
- 1 lb mixed mushrooms (shiitake, porcini, button), sliced
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 1/2 cup walnuts, roughly chopped
- 1/4 cup dried cranberries
- 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
- 3 tbsp balsamic vinegar
- 1 tbsp maple syrup
- 1 tsp Dijon mustard
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil

## Instructions

- Rinse wild rice thoroughly under cold water.
- In a medium saucepan, bring water to a boil. Add wild rice, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and most grains are burst open, about 45 minutes.
- Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius).
- Toss sliced mushrooms with 1 tbsp olive oil, salt, and pepper. Spread them on a baking sheet and roast for about 20 minutes, until golden and tender.
- In a dry skillet, toast walnuts over medium heat until fragrant, about 5 minutes.
- In a large bowl, combine cooked wild rice, roasted mushrooms, toasted walnuts, dried cranberries, and chopped parsley.
- In a small bowl, whisk together balsamic vinegar, maple syrup, Dijon mustard, minced garlic, and extra virgin olive oil. Pour over the salad and toss to combine.
- Season with additional salt and pepper if needed and serve warm or at room temperature.
