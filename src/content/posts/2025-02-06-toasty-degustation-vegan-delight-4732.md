Welcome to a dish that captures the essence of our toasty degustation menu today. This recipe is designed to bring warmth, flavor, and texture into every bite, making it the highlight of your culinary day.

## Ingredients

- 200g dehydrated watermelon, thinly sliced
- 150g jackfruit, shredded
- 1 avocado, sliced
- 100g tempura batter
- 200ml ice water
- 100g sweet potato, sliced
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp mirin
- 1 tsp wasabi paste
- 1 cup sushi rice
- 1.5 cups water
- 2 tbsp rice vinegar
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1/2 tsp salt
- Nori sheets

## Instructions

1. Prepare the sushi rice by washing it under cold water until the water runs clear. Combine with 1.5 cups water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 18 minutes.
2. Mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl until dissolved. Gently fold into cooked rice and allow to cool to room temperature.
3. Rehydrate the watermelon slices in a mixture of soy sauce and mirin for 30 minutes to mimic 'tuna'.
4. Prepare tempura by dipping sweet potato slices into a batter made from tempura flour and ice water; fry until golden and crisp.
5. Assemble the sushi by placing a sheet of nori on a bamboo mat, spreading rice evenly, and layering with 'tuna' watermelon, avocado, and tempura sweet potato. Roll tightly and slice.
6. Serve with wasabi, soy sauce, and pickled ginger.

Enjoy this delightful creation that not only satisfies the palate but also brings a touch of elegance to your table. Perfect for any occasion, this dish promises to be a new favorite.
