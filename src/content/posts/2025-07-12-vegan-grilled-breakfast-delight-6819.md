## Introduction

Begin your morning with a heartwarming, vegan twist on the traditional grilled breakfast. This dish blends the smoky flavors of grilled vegetables with the richness of tofu scramble, creating a perfect start to your day.

## Ingredients

- 200g firm tofu, crumbled
- 1 red bell pepper, sliced
- 1 zucchini, sliced
- 1 small red onion, sliced
- 10 cherry tomatoes, halved
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tsp turmeric
- 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- 1 tbsp nutritional yeast
- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

## Instructions

1. Heat a grill pan over medium heat and brush with some olive oil.
2. Place the sliced bell pepper, zucchini, and red onion on the grill pan. Grill until they are tender and have grill marks, about 4-5 minutes per side.
3. In a bowl, mix the crumbled tofu with turmeric, smoked paprika, nutritional yeast, salt, and pepper.
4. Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat and add the seasoned tofu. Cook for about 5-6 minutes, stirring frequently, until the tofu is golden and aromatic.
5. Arrange the grilled vegetables on a plate, top with the tofu scramble, and garnish with cherry tomatoes and fresh parsley.

Enjoy this delightful vegan grilled breakfast with a cup of green tea or freshly squeezed orange juice for a complete morning feast. It's a wonderful way to energize and treat yourself to a nutritious meal!
