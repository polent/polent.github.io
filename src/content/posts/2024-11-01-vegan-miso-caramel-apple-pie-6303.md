## Introduction

Dive into the delightful world of savory desserts with today's special: a Vegan Miso Caramel Apple Pie. This unique creation combines the umami richness of miso with the classic sweetness of apple pie, making for an intriguing dessert that's both comforting and sophisticated.

## Ingredients

- 1 pre-made vegan pie crust
- 5 medium apples, peeled, cored, and thinly sliced
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 1/4 cup white miso paste
- 1/4 cup water
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp nutmeg
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 2 tbsp cornstarch
- 1 tbsp vegan butter, melted

## Instructions

- Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
- In a large mixing bowl, toss the sliced apples with lemon juice, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cornstarch.
- In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine brown sugar, miso paste, and water. Stir continuously until the mixture becomes smooth and thickens slightly to form a caramel.
- Pour the miso caramel over the apple mixture and mix until the apples are evenly coated.
- Transfer the apple filling into the pie crust, spreading it out evenly.
- Brush the top of the pie with melted vegan butter.
- Bake in the preheated oven for about 45-50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.
- Allow the pie to cool slightly before serving.

Enjoy this delectable twist on a traditional favorite, perfect for impressing guests or indulging on a cozy evening at home. Serve warm with a dollop of vegan ice cream for the ultimate treat.
