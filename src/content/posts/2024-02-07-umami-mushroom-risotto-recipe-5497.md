## Introduction

For today's umami-packed lunch, indulge in a deliciously satisfying vegan Mushroom Risotto. This Italian classic is elevated with the rich flavors of mushrooms and a creamy, dairy-free twist. Get ready to savor the comforting and earthy goodness of this plant-based delight.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups Arborio rice
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 4 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 lb mixed mushrooms (such as cremini, shiitake, and oyster), sliced
- 4 cups vegetable broth
- 1 cup dry white wine
- 1/2 cup nutritional yeast
- 1/4 cup vegan butter
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

## Instructions

1. In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and saut√© until translucent.
2. Add the sliced mushrooms to the pot and cook until they release their moisture and start to brown.
3. Push the mushrooms to one side of the pot and add the Arborio rice. Toast the rice for a few minutes until it becomes slightly golden.
4. Pour in the white wine and cook until it is absorbed by the rice, stirring frequently.
5. Begin adding the vegetable broth, one cup at a time, stirring continuously and allowing the rice to absorb the broth before adding more. Repeat until all the broth is used and the rice is cooked al dente.
6. Stir in the nutritional yeast, vegan butter, soy sauce, dried thyme, salt, and pepper. Cook for another 2-3 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
7. Remove the pot from heat and let the risotto rest for a few minutes. This will allow it to become creamier.
8. Serve the Mushroom Risotto hot, garnished with fresh chopped parsley.

Enjoy the tantalizing flavors of this vegan Mushroom Risotto for a truly satisfying umami-packed lunch. With its creamy texture and hearty mushroom goodness, this dish is sure to become a favorite in your recipe repertoire.
