## Introduction

Start your day with a burst of flavor and texture with this Crusted Vegan Breakfast Quiche. This dish blends the richness of a tofu-based filling with the crunch of a whole grain crust, all seasoned with Asian-inspired spices for a truly delightful morning.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- 1/2 cup cold vegan butter, cubed
- 1/4 cup ice water
- 1 block (14 oz) firm tofu, drained and crumbled
- 1/4 cup nutritional yeast
- 1 teaspoon turmeric
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon black salt (kala namak)
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1/2 cup chopped green onions
- 1/2 cup finely chopped bell pepper
- 1/2 cup shredded vegan cheese
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. In a mixing bowl, combine the whole wheat flour and salt. Add the cubed vegan butter and mix until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
3. Gradually add ice water and knead until a dough forms. Wrap in plastic and chill for 30 minutes.
4. In a separate bowl, mix crumbled tofu, nutritional yeast, turmeric, smoked paprika, black salt, and soy sauce.
5. Heat olive oil in a skillet. Sauté green onions and bell pepper until soft.
6. Combine sautéed vegetables with the tofu mixture and stir in shredded vegan cheese.
7. Roll out the chilled dough and press into a pie dish. Pour the tofu filling into the crust.
8. Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes or until the crust is golden and the filling is set.
9. Let cool slightly before serving.

Enjoy this warm, comforting vegan breakfast quiche that’s perfect for any morning. Serve it hot, straight out of the oven, and watch it become a new favorite in your breakfast repertoire!
