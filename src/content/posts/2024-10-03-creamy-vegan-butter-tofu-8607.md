## Introduction

Tonight's dinner embraces the lush, buttery textures of vegan ingredients, transforming them into a sumptuous, comforting meal. This creamy vegan 'butter' tofu recipe is inspired by the rich flavors of Indian butter chicken but crafted entirely from plant-based components.

## Ingredients

- 200g firm tofu, pressed and cubed
- 2 tbsp vegan butter
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 inch ginger, grated
- 1 can (400 ml) coconut milk
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 1 tsp garam masala
- 1 tsp turmeric powder
- 1/2 tsp chili powder
- 1/2 tsp cumin powder
- Salt to taste
- Fresh cilantro, chopped for garnish

## Instructions

1. Heat the vegan butter in a large skillet over medium heat.
2. Add the onions and saut√© until they are soft and translucent.
3. Stir in the garlic and ginger, and cook for another minute until fragrant.
4. Mix in the tomato paste and all the spices (garam masala, turmeric, chili powder, cumin), and cook for 2-3 minutes.
5. Add the cubed tofu and gently toss to coat with the spice mixture.
6. Pour in the coconut milk and bring the mixture to a simmer. Reduce the heat and let it cook for about 10 minutes, or until the sauce thickens.
