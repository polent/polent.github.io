## Ingredients

- 1 cup sushi rice
- 2 cups water
- 2 tbsp rice vinegar
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 block of firm tofu, pressed and cut into bite-sized pieces
- 1/4 cup cornstarch
- 1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs

- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 1 tbsp sesame oil

## Instructions

1. Rinse the sushi rice until the water runs clear. Combine rice and water in a rice cooker and cook according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Once the rice is cooked, mix in rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Set aside to cool.
3. Toss the tofu pieces in cornstarch, then dip in water followed by panko breadcrumbs, ensuring they are well coated.
