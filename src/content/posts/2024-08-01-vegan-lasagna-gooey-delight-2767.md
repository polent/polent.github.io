## Introduction

Tonight's dinner brings the comfort and warmth of a classic dish with a delightful vegan twist. We're preparing a gooey, indulgent vegan lasagna, layered with rich tomato sauce, creamy cashew béchamel, and a bounty of vegetables.

## Ingredients

- 12 whole wheat lasagna noodles
- 2 cups cashews, soaked for 4 hours
- 1/2 cup nutritional yeast
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tbsp lemon juice
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 3 cups marinara sauce
- 2 zucchinis, thinly sliced
- 1 eggplant, thinly sliced
- 1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
- 1 cup spinach leaves
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- Vegan parmesan, for topping

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. Cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions, then set aside.
3. In a blender, combine soaked cashews, nutritional yeast, garlic, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Blend until smooth to make the cashew béchamel.
4. In a pan, sauté zucchini, eggplant, and bell pepper with olive oil until tender.
5. To assemble the lasagna, spread a layer of marinara sauce on the bottom of a baking dish. Layer with noodles, cashew béchamel, vegetables, and spinach. Repeat layers, finishing with marinara sauce.
6. Cover with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Remove foil, sprinkle vegan parmesan on top, and bake for an additional 10 minutes.
7. Let the lasagna cool for 10 minutes before serving.

Serve this hearty vegan lasagna with a side of fresh basil leaves and a crisp green salad for a perfect evening meal. Enjoy the layers of flavor and textures in each bite!
