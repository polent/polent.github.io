## Introduction

Embrace the comforting warmth and bold flavors of tonight's peppery dinner with this unique Vegan Peppery Tofu and Vegetable Stir-Fry. This dish is a fusion of crisp vegetables, spicy tofu, and a tantalizing sauce that brings the heat and heartiness to your dinner table.

## Ingredients

- 200g firm tofu, pressed and cubed
- 1 red bell pepper, sliced
- 1 green bell pepper, sliced
- 1 yellow bell pepper, sliced
- 1 large carrot, thinly sliced
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon black pepper, freshly ground
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1/2 cup vegetable broth
- 2 teaspoons chili flakes (optional for extra heat)
- Fresh basil leaves for garnish

## Instructions

1. In a bowl, combine the cubed tofu with soy sauce, black pepper, garlic powder, and cornstarch. Mix well to coat the tofu evenly.
2. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the tofu cubes and stir-fry until golden brown on all sides. Remove tofu from the skillet and set aside.
3. In the same skillet, add a bit more oil if needed, and stir-fry the bell peppers and carrot until just tender.
4. Return the tofu to the skillet with the vegetables. Add vegetable broth and sesame oil, mixing well.
5. Cook for an additional 3-5 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken slightly.
6. If desired, sprinkle with chili flakes for extra heat. Garnish with fresh basil leaves before serving.

Serve this delightful Vegan Peppery Tofu and Vegetable Stir-Fry hot, perfect on its own or alongside some steamed rice for a fulfilling meal. Enjoy the blend of spices and textures that make every bite a celebration of flavors!
