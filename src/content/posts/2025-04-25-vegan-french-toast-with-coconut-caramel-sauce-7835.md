## Ingredients

- 4 slices of thick vegan bread (such as brioche or challah)
- 1 cup unsweetened almond milk
- 1/4 cup chickpea flour
- 1 tbsp maple syrup
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon

- 1 can (400 ml) full-fat coconut milk
- 1/2 cup brown sugar

## Instructions

- In a shallow bowl, whisk together almond milk, chickpea flour, maple syrup, vanilla extract, cinnamon, salt, and nutritional yeast.
- Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and add a bit of coconut oil.
- Dip each slice of bread in the mixture, ensuring both sides are well coated.
- Fry each slice for about 2-3 minutes on each side or until golden brown and crispy.
- For the sauce, combine coconut milk, brown sugar, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt in a saucepan over medium heat.
