## Introduction

Dive into the vibrant world of street food with this delicious vegan African-inspired Shawarma. Itâ€™s a delightful twist on the classic, packed with rich spices, succulent textures, and the warmth of home-cooked meals, all wrapped in a soft, homemade flatbread.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups of textured vegetable protein (TVP)
- 1 tablespoon smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- Juice of one lemon
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 4 homemade or store-bought vegan flatbreads
- 1 cup chopped lettuce
- 1 large tomato, diced
- 1/2 cucumber, sliced
- Vegan tzatziki sauce
- Optional: Sliced onions, pickled vegetables, or hot sauce

## Instructions

1. Hydrate the TVP in hot water for about 10 minutes, then drain and squeeze out excess water.
2. In a bowl, mix smoked paprika, cumin, coriander, cayenne pepper, minced garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil to create the marinade.
3. Toss the hydrated TVP in the marinade and let sit for at least 20 minutes to absorb the flavors.
4. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and cook the marinated TVP until crispy, about 5-7 minutes.
5. Warm the flatbreads and assemble the shawarma by placing some chopped lettuce, diced tomatoes, and sliced cucumbers on each flatbread.
6. Add the cooked TVP and top with vegan tzatziki sauce. Add optional onions, pickled vegetables, or hot sauce as desired.
7. Roll up the flatbreads and serve warm.

Enjoy this vegan Shawarma as a fulfilling meal that brings a taste of African street food right to your table. Perfect for any time of the day and sure to be a hit with family and friends!
