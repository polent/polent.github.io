## Ingredients

- 1 cup shredded cabbage
- 1/2 cup finely chopped carrots
- 1/4 cup finely chopped green onions
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon grated ginger
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 cup firm tofu, crumbled
- 20 vegan dumpling wrappers
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil for frying
- **For the Dipping Sauce:**
  - 2 tablespoons soy sauce
  - 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
  - 1 teaspoon chili sauce
  - 1 teaspoon sesame oil
  - 1/2 teaspoon sugar

## Instructions

- In a large bowl, combine cabbage, carrots, green onions, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, sesame oil, salt, and pepper. Mix well.
- Add the crumbled tofu to the vegetable mixture and stir to combine.
- Place a tablespoon of the filling in the center of each dumpling wrapper. Wet the edges of the wrapper with water, fold over to form a half-moon shape, and press to seal.
- Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place the dumplings in the skillet and cook until the bottoms are golden brown, about 2-3 minutes.
- Add 1/4 cup water to the skillet, cover, and let the dumplings steam until the water has evaporated and the dumplings are cooked through, about 5-7 minutes.
- For the dipping sauce, combine all sauce ingredients in a small bowl and stir until the sugar dissolves.
- Serve the dumplings hot with the dipping sauce on the side.
