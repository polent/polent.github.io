## Introduction

This mild bread recipe is perfect for those who appreciate subtle flavors in their baked goods. Infused with a hint of rosemary and olive oil, it's a delightful accompaniment to any meal or a delicious base for vegan sandwiches.

## Ingredients

- 500g all-purpose flour
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 2 tsp salt
- 1 packet (7g) active dry yeast
- 300ml warm water
- 3 tbsp olive oil
- 2 tbsp fresh rosemary, finely chopped

## Instructions

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and salt.
2. Dissolve the yeast in the warm water and let it sit for about 5 minutes until frothy.
3. Add the yeast mixture and olive oil to the dry ingredients and mix until a dough forms.
4. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 10 minutes, then fold in the chopped rosemary.
5. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for 1 hour, or until doubled in size.
6. Punch down the dough, shape it into a loaf, and place it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
7. Cover and let rise again for 30 minutes.
8. Preheat the oven to 200°C (390°F).
9. Bake the bread for 25-30 minutes, or until golden brown and hollow-sounding when tapped.
10. Let cool on a wire rack before slicing.

Enjoy this lovely mild bread fresh out of the oven, or toast it for a crunchy treat. It's versatility makes it a wonderful addition to your vegan recipe collection.
