## Introduction

Embrace the chill of the season with a luxurious brunch dish designed to warm your heart and palate. This vegan Mushroom and Spinach Polenta Brunch Bowl is a comforting, savory bowl that combines earthy mushrooms, vibrant spinach, and creamy polenta, topped with a rich, sun-dried tomato cashew cream.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup polenta
- 4 cups water or vegetable broth
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 300g fresh mushrooms, sliced
- 200g fresh spinach
- 1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes, soaked and drained
- 1/2 cup raw cashews, soaked for 4 hours and drained
- 2 tbsp nutritional yeast
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh basil for garnish

## Instructions

1. In a medium saucepan, bring water or vegetable broth to a boil. Add salt and gradually whisk in polenta. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring often, until polenta is thick and creamy, about 20 minutes.
2. While polenta cooks, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute.
3. Add mushrooms and cook until they are soft and browned, about 8 minutes. Add spinach and cook until wilted, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
4. For the sun-dried tomato cashew cream, blend sun-dried tomatoes, cashews, nutritional yeast, lemon juice, and enough water to achieve a creamy consistency in a blender until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.
5. To serve, spoon polenta into bowls, top with sautéed mushrooms and spinach, and drizzle with sun-dried tomato cashew cream. Garnish with fresh basil.
