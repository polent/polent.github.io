## Ingredients

- 1 cup vital wheat gluten
- 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon liquid smoke

- 2 tablespoons maple syrup
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon minced ginger
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, combine vital wheat gluten, nutritional yeast, smoked paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder.
2. In another bowl, whisk together soy sauce, liquid smoke, water, orange zest, orange juice, lemon zest, lemon juice, maple syrup, sesame oil, minced ginger, and minced garlic.
3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until a dough forms. Knead the dough for about 3 minutes.
