## Introduction

Inspired by the cozy ambiance of a warm high tea, this recipe blends the comforting warmth of tea with the richness of vegan cuisine. Introducing the Vegan Matcha Scones with Chia Jam - a dish that promises to elevate your tea time with its delicate flavors and heartwarming textures.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1/4 cup organic sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon matcha powder
- 1/3 cup coconut oil, solid
- 3/4 cup almond milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar

**For the Chia Jam:**
- 1 cup frozen mixed berries
- 2 tablespoons chia seeds
- 2 tablespoons maple syrup

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, sugar, salt, and matcha powder.
3. Add the solid coconut oil and use a pastry cutter or fork to blend it into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
4. In a separate bowl, mix the almond milk, vanilla extract, and apple cider vinegar. Add this to the dry ingredients and stir until just combined.
5. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and shape into a round disc about 1 inch thick. Cut into 8 wedges and place on the prepared baking sheet.
6. Bake for 15-17 minutes or until the edges are lightly golden.
7. While the scones bake, prepare the chia jam by combining the berries, chia seeds, and maple syrup in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook for 5-10 minutes until the berries break down and the mixture thickens. Remove from heat and let cool.
8. Serve the warm scones with a dollop of chia jam.

Enjoy these Vegan Matcha Scones fresh out of the oven, paired with the vibrant chia jam, for a high tea experience that's both nourishing and indulgent. Perfect for a lazy afternoon or a sophisticated gathering.
