Today, I have a delightful recipe for a citrusy bread that is bursting with flavor. This bread is perfect for breakfast or as a sweet treat any time of the day. The combination of citrus fruits adds a refreshing twist to this classic bread.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup sugar

- Zest of 1 lemon
- Zest of 1 orange

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a loaf pan.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
3. In a separate bowl, combine the plant-based milk, orange juice, lemon zest, orange zest, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract.
4. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until just combined.
5. Gently fold in the chopped mixed citrus fruits.
