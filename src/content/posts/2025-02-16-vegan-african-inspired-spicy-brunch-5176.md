- Add cumin seeds, coriander seeds, smoked paprika, and cayenne pepper to the onions, stirring until fragrant.
- Mix in the diced sweet potatoes and red bell pepper, cooking until they start to soften.
- Stir in the chickpeas, diced tomatoes, and coconut milk. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat and let simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the sweet potatoes are tender and the stew has thickened.
- Serve the spicy vegetable stew over the warm millet porridge. Garnish with chopped cilantro and slices of avocado.
