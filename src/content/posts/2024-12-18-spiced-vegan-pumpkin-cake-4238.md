Dive into the world of spiced desserts with a recipe that encapsulates the warmth and complexity of today's flavor trends. This unique dessert combines the richness of spices with a delicate sweetness, making it an unforgettable treat to enjoy any day.

## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1/2 tsp ground ginger
* 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
* 1/4 tsp ground cloves
* 1/8 tsp ground cardamom
* 1 cup pumpkin puree
* 1 cup vegan sugar
* 1/2 cup vegetable oil
* 1/4 cup water
* 1 tsp vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9-inch cake pan.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt, and spices.
3. In another bowl, mix the pumpkin puree, sugar, vegetable oil, water, and vanilla extract until well combined.
4. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined.
5. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan.
6. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
7. Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.

Serve this delightful spiced dessert warm, ideally paired with a dollop of vegan cream or ice cream. It's a perfect way to end a meal on a sweet note, or to enjoy as a cozy afternoon treat with a cup of tea or coffee.
