Introducing the Macerated Gourmet Vegan Burger, a dish that encapsulates the sophisticated flavors and textures of gourmet cuisine, tailored for the vegan palate. This burger is not just a meal; it's an experience, designed to elevate your day with its rich and diverse flavor profile.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups textured vegetable protein (TVP)
- 1/4 cup red wine vinegar
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon maple syrup

- 1/4 cup finely chopped red onion
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 cup breadcrumbs
- Salt to taste
- 4 vegan burger buns

## Instructions

1. In a bowl, combine TVP, red wine vinegar, soy sauce, maple syrup, smoked paprika, and black pepper. Let it sit for 20 minutes to macerate.
2. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add red onion and garlic, saut√© until translucent.
