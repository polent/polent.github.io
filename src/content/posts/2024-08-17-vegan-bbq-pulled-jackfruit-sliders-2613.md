## Introduction

Get ready to impress your guests with a vegan twist on a classic appetizer. These Vegan BBQ Pulled Jackfruit Sliders are packed with flavor and sure to be a crowd-pleaser at any gathering.

## Ingredients

- 2 cans (20 oz each) young green jackfruit in brine, drained and rinsed
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1 cup vegan BBQ sauce
- 12 small slider buns, preferably whole wheat
- 1 cup vegan coleslaw
- Optional garnish: chopped cilantro or pickles

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. Pull the jackfruit pieces apart with your hands or a fork to mimic the texture of pulled pork.
3. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic, cooking until onions are translucent.
4. Add the shredded jackfruit, smoked paprika, cumin, black pepper, and salt to the skillet. Stir well to combine.
5. Cook for about 5 minutes, then add the BBQ sauce. Stir well, ensuring the jackfruit is evenly coated.
6. Transfer the saucy jackfruit to a baking dish and spread it out evenly. Bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes, until the edges are slightly crispy.
7. Toast the slider buns lightly, if desired.
8. Assemble the sliders by placing a generous amount of pulled jackfruit on the bottom half of each bun. Top with a spoonful of vegan coleslaw and optional garnish.
9. Cover with the top half of the bun and serve warm.

Serve these delightful sliders warm, and watch them disappear! They're perfect for parties, family gatherings, or even as a tasty snack during game night.
