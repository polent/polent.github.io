## Introduction

Embrace the delightful contrast of sweet and salty with this unique dessert, where the richness of caramel meets the subtle bite of sea salt. This Salted Caramel Chocolate Tart is not only a feast for the taste buds but also a visually stunning addition to any dining table.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup cocoa powder
- 1/4 cup powdered sugar
- 1/2 cup vegan butter, chilled and cubed
- 1-2 tbsp cold water
- 1 cup vegan dark chocolate, chopped
- 1 cup full-fat coconut milk
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 2 tbsp water
- 1/2 tsp sea salt, plus extra for garnish
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. In a mixing bowl, combine flour, cocoa powder, and powdered sugar. Add vegan butter and rub into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.
3. Gradually add cold water and mix until a dough forms. Press the dough into a tart tin, and prick the base with a fork.
4. Bake the crust for 20 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool.
5. For the caramel, combine brown sugar and water in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir until sugar dissolves and mixture begins to bubble. Add coconut milk and salt, stirring continuously until the mixture thickens.
6. Remove from heat, add vanilla extract, and pour over the cooled crust. Allow to set for about 1 hour.
7. Melt the dark chocolate and spread over the set caramel. Sprinkle with a little sea salt.
8. Refrigerate until the chocolate sets. Slice and serve.

Serve this luxurious tart as a perfect ending to a meal or as a special treat to brighten up your afternoon. Its harmonious blend of flavors is sure to delight everyone who tries it.
