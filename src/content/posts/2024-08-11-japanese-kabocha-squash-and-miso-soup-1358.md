## Introduction

Today's mellow soup is a nourishing Japanese-inspired Kabocha Squash and Miso Soup. This comforting bowl combines the sweetness of kabocha squash with the umami richness of miso, perfect for a soothing dinner.

## Ingredients

- 1 medium kabocha squash, peeled, seeded, and cubed
- 4 cups vegetable broth
- 2 tablespoons light miso paste
- 1 onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon ginger, grated
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 2 scallions, thinly sliced for garnish
- Salt to taste
- Fresh cracked pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. In a large pot, heat the sesame oil over medium heat.
2. Add the chopped onion, garlic, and ginger. Sauté until the onion becomes translucent.
3. Add the kabocha squash cubes to the pot and sauté for another 5 minutes.
4. Pour in the vegetable broth and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until the squash is tender, about 15-20 minutes.
5. Remove from heat. Use an immersion blender to purée the soup until smooth.
6. Take a small amount of the soup and mix with miso paste to dissolve it, then stir it back into the pot.
7. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
8. Serve hot, garnished with sliced scallions.

Serve this warm, comforting soup as a gentle start to your meal or as a light dinner on its own. The flavors are mellow yet distinctly satisfying, making it ideal for any season.
