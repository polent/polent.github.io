Experience a delightful crunch with today's innovative vegan bread recipe. This bread is not only satisfying to bite into but also packed with wholesome ingredients that cater to health-conscious and environmentally aware eaters.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups whole wheat flour
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 packet (7g) active dry yeast
- 1 1/4 cups warm water
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1/2 cup mixed seeds (sunflower, pumpkin, flaxseed)

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, mix the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, sugar, and salt.
2. Dissolve the yeast in warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until frothy.
3. Add the yeast mixture and olive oil to the flour mixture. Mix until a dough forms.
4. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for 10 minutes.
5. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover, and let it rise in a warm place for 1 hour.
6. Punch down the dough, and form it into a loaf shape. Sprinkle the mixed seeds on top and press lightly to adhere.
7. Place the dough on a baking sheet and let it rise for another 30 minutes.
8. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
9. Bake the bread for 25-30 minutes or until the crust is golden and sounds hollow when tapped.
