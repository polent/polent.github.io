- 1/2 cup vegan BBQ sauce
- 1 cup shredded vegan cheese
- 1/2 cup caramelized onions
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
- 1 tablespoon olive oil, for brushing
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Roll out the thawed puff pastry on a lightly floured surface.
3. Spread the BBQ sauce evenly over the pastry.
4. Sprinkle the shredded vegan cheese and caramelized onions over the sauce.
5. Sprinkle garlic powder and smoked paprika evenly over the toppings.
6. Starting from the long side, roll the pastry tightly into a log.
7. Cut the log into 1/2-inch thick slices and place them flat on the prepared baking sheet.
