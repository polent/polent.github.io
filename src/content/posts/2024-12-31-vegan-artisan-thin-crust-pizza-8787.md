## Introduction

Inspired by the artisanal, thin-crust pizzas, this recipe brings a delightful vegan twist, incorporating fresh, plant-based ingredients atop a crispy, homemade crust. Perfect for any meal, this pizza is both nourishing and satisfying.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup warm water
- 1 tsp sugar
- 2 tsp active dry yeast
- 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (or gluten-free alternative)
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1/2 cup tomato sauce
- 1 cup shredded vegan mozzarella cheese
- 1/2 red onion, thinly sliced
- 1/2 bell pepper, thinly sliced
- 1/4 cup black olives, sliced
- 1/4 cup fresh basil leaves
- 1/4 cup artichoke hearts, chopped
- 1/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- Chili flakes, to taste

## Instructions

- In a large bowl, dissolve sugar in warm water and sprinkle yeast on top. Let it sit for 10 minutes until frothy.
- Add flour, salt, and olive oil to the yeast mixture. Stir until a dough forms then knead on a floured surface for about 5 minutes.
- Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover, and let it rise in a warm area for 1 hour, or until doubled in size.
- Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C).
- Roll out the dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness and transfer to a pizza stone or baking sheet.
- Spread tomato sauce evenly over the dough, then top with vegan cheese, red onion, bell pepper, black olives, artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomatoes, and garlic.
- Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly.
- Remove from oven, sprinkle with fresh basil and chili flakes, and serve hot.

Enjoy this fresh, vibrant vegan artisan pizza as a testament to how versatile and delightful plant-based cooking can be. It's perfect for a cozy night in or for impressing guests at your next dinner party.
