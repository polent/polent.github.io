## Introduction

Today, I'm excited to share a uniquely African-inspired vegan soup that's as silky as it is nutritious. This creamy African Peanut Soup combines the rich flavors of peanut butter with the earthy tones of sweet potatoes and a hint of spice. Perfect for a comforting meal!

## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon ginger, grated
- 2 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and diced
- 1 red bell pepper, chopped
- 1 teaspoon cumin
- 1 teaspoon coriander
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (adjust according to taste)
- 4 cups vegetable broth
- 1 cup natural peanut butter (smooth)
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- Chopped cilantro and roasted peanuts, for garnish

## Instructions

1. Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, garlic, and ginger, and saut√© until the onion becomes translucent.
2. Add the sweet potatoes, red bell pepper, cumin, coriander, and cayenne pepper. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
3. Pour in the vegetable broth and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until the sweet potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes.
4. Stir in the peanut butter and tomato paste until well combined. Continue to simmer for another 10 minutes.
5. Use an immersion blender to blend the soup directly in the pot until smooth. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.
6. Serve the soup hot, garnished with chopped cilantro and roasted peanuts.

Serve this warm, comforting soup with a side of crusty bread or a portion of steamed rice for a complete meal. It's sure to become a new favorite in your home!
