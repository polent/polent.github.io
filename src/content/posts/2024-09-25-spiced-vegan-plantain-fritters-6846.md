## Introduction

Today, I'm delighted to share a unique vegan twist on a traditional African side dish: Spiced Vegan Plantain Fritters. These fritters are crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and packed with aromatic spices that bring a burst of African flavors to your plate.

## Ingredients

- 2 ripe plantains, peeled and mashed
- 1 cup chickpea flour
- 1/2 cup water
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- Salt to taste
- Oil for frying

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, combine the mashed plantains with chickpea flour and water. Mix until well combined.
2. Stir in cumin, paprika, turmeric, cayenne pepper, and salt. Mix until the spices are evenly distributed.
3. Heat oil in a frying pan over medium heat.
4. Scoop tablespoons of the plantain mixture into the hot oil. Flatten slightly with the back of a spoon.
5. Fry for 2-3 minutes on each side or until golden and crispy.
6. Remove from oil and place on paper towels to drain excess oil.
7. Serve warm.

Serve these Spiced Vegan Plantain Fritters hot, alongside your favorite dipping sauce or as a complement to any main dish. They're sure to add a delightful texture and flavor to any meal!
