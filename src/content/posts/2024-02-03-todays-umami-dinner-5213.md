## Ingredients

- 1 pack of shiitake mushrooms
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon maple syrup
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1 block of firm tofu
- 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
- 1 tablespoon miso paste
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- 1 tablespoon mirin
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1-inch piece of ginger, grated
- 1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
- 1 cup broccoli florets
- 1 cup snow peas
- 2 cups cooked jasmine rice
- 2 green onions, chopped
- Sesame seeds, for garnish

## Instructions

- Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
- In a bowl, mix together soy sauce, maple syrup, and sesame oil. Brush the shiitake mushrooms with the mixture, ensuring they are well-coated. Place the mushrooms on a baking sheet and roast for 15-20 minutes until they are tender and slightly crispy.
- Drain and press the tofu to remove excess moisture. Cut the tofu into small cubes.
- In a separate bowl, combine nutritional yeast, miso paste, rice vinegar, mirin, and cornstarch. Whisk until smooth.
- Heat vegetable oil in a pan over medium heat. Add minced garlic and grated ginger, sauté for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.
- Add the tofu cubes to the pan and cook until golden brown on all sides.
- Pour the miso sauce over the tofu, stirring gently to coat the cubes. Cook for another 2-3 minutes until the sauce thickens.
- In a separate pan, stir-fry the bell pepper, broccoli, and snow peas until crisp-tender.
- Serve the tofu over a bed of jasmine rice, topped with the stir-fried vegetables.
- Garnish with green onions and sesame seeds. Enjoy this umami feast!
