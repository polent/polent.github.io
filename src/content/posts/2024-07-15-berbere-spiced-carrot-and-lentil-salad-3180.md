## Introduction

Today's recipe is a vibrant and hearty Ethiopian-inspired Berbere Spiced Carrot and Lentil Salad. This dish perfectly combines the warm, aromatic flavors of Berbere spice with the earthiness of lentils and the sweetness of carrots, creating a delightful side that's both nourishing and satisfying.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup dried red lentils
- 4 large carrots, peeled and grated
- 1 medium red onion, finely diced
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 teaspoons Berbere spice mix
- Juice of one lemon
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Optional: A handful of roasted peanuts for garnish

## Instructions

1. Rinse the lentils under cold water until the water runs clear.
2. In a medium saucepan, combine lentils with 2 cups of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for about 15 minutes or until lentils are tender but still hold their shape.
3. Drain the lentils and set aside to cool.
4. While the lentils are cooking, heat the olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the diced onions and cook until they are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
5. Add the grated carrots to the pan, along with the Berbere spice mix, and sauté for another 5-7 minutes until the carrots are tender.
6. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.
7. In a large bowl, combine the cooked lentils, sautéed carrots and onions, lemon juice, and chopped cilantro. Mix well.
8. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
9. Garnish with roasted peanuts if using, and serve.
