## Introduction

Today's special from Chef Isabella's kitchen is a vibrant Vegan Asian-Inspired Risotto. This dish brings together creamy Arborio rice, infused with coconut milk and a hint of lemongrass, perfectly complemented by the crunch of stir-fried vegetables and the freshness of cilantro. It's a comforting yet light dish perfect for any day.

## Ingredients

* 1 cup Arborio rice
* 2 tablespoons coconut oil
* 1 small onion, finely chopped
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 tablespoon finely chopped ginger
* 1 stalk lemongrass, tender part only, finely chopped
* 3 cups vegetable broth
* 1 cup coconut milk
* 1 cup mixed bell peppers, thinly sliced
* 1/2 cup green peas
* 1/2 cup corn kernels
* 1 tablespoon soy sauce
* 1/2 teaspoon white pepper
* Salt to taste
* 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro for garnish
* Lime wedges for serving

## Instructions

1. Heat the coconut oil in a large pan over medium heat.
2. Add the onion, garlic, ginger, and lemongrass. Sauté until the onions are translucent.
3. Stir in the Arborio rice until well coated with the oil and lightly toasted.
4. Gradually add the vegetable broth, one cup at a time, stirring continuously until the liquid is absorbed before adding more.
5. Once the rice is half cooked, stir in the coconut milk and continue to cook, adding more broth if necessary.
6. Add the bell peppers, green peas, and corn. Cook until the vegetables are just tender and the rice is creamy and al dente.
7. Stir in the soy sauce, white pepper, and salt to taste.
8. Remove from heat and garnish with chopped cilantro. Serve with lime wedges on the side.

Enjoy this delightful fusion of Italian technique and Asian flavors, a perfect example of how traditional dishes can be transformed with a creative, plant-based twist. Pair this risotto with a crisp white wine for an exquisite meal experience.
