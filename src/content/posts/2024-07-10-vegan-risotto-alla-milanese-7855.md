Using Arborio rice and a medley of aromatic herbs, this dish captures the essence of traditional Italian cuisine while adhering to a vegan diet.

## Ingredients

- 1/4 teaspoon saffron threads
- 1/2 cup white wine (vegan)
- 1 tablespoon nutritional yeast
- 1 tablespoon vegan butter
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Fresh parsley, chopped for garnish

## Instructions

1. In a large saucepan, melt the vegan butter over medium heat.
2. Add the chopped onion and garlic, saut√© until they are soft and translucent.
3. Stir in the Arborio rice, making sure it's well-coated with the butter and onion mixture.
4. Add the white wine and let it simmer until it has almost evaporated.
5. Add the saffron threads to the heated vegetable broth.
6. Gradually add the broth one ladle at a time, stirring continuously, until the rice absorbs the liquid and becomes creamy.
