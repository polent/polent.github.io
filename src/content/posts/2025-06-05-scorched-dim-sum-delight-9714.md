Place a small spoonful of the filling into the center of each wonton wrapper.\n3. Moisten the edges of the wrapper with water, fold to form a triangle, and press to seal.\n4. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and brush with sesame oil.\n5. Place the filled wontons in the skillet and cook until the bottoms are golden brown, about 2-3 minutes.\n6. Add a small amount of water to the skillet and cover immediately to steam the wontons for another 2-3 minutes.\n7.
