## Introduction

Today, let's create a dish that encapsulates the spirit of a warm, comforting, fatty drink but in a solid, nourishing form. This Vegan Coconut Rice Pudding is inspired by the richness of coconut cream and the subtle sweetness of coconut water, offering a creamy texture and a touch of tropical flavor.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup Arborio rice or short grain rice
- 2 cups coconut milk
- 1 cup coconut water
- 1/4 cup maple syrup or agave syrup
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- Optional toppings: toasted coconut flakes, sliced almonds, fresh berries

## Instructions

1. Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear.
2. In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed rice, coconut milk, coconut water, and salt.
3. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce to a simmer.
4. Stir in the maple syrup, vanilla extract, and cinnamon.
5. Simmer for 25-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the rice is tender and the mixture has thickened to your desired consistency.
6. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.
7. Serve warm or chilled, topped with toasted coconut flakes, sliced almonds, and fresh berries if desired.
