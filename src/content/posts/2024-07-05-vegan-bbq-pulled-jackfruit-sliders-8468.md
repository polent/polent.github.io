## Ingredients

- 2 cans young green jackfruit in brine, drained and rinsed
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1/2 tsp ground cumin
- 1/2 tsp chili powder
- 1 cup vegan BBQ sauce
- 12 small slider buns, preferably whole wheat

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).

5. Cook the jackfruit mixture for about 10 minutes, until it starts to brown slightly.
6. Pour in the BBQ sauce and reduce the heat to low. Simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
7. Divide the BBQ jackfruit evenly among the slider buns. Top each with a generous tablespoon of vegan coleslaw.
