## Introduction

Today's encrusted seasonal special is a delightful blend of crisp textures and warm, comforting flavors. This dish, a Vegan Encrusted Butternut Squash with a Nutty Panko Topping, perfectly marries the sweetness of autumn squash with the savory crunch of a spiced nutty crust.

## Ingredients

- 1 large butternut squash, peeled and sliced into 1/2-inch thick rounds
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 1 cup panko breadcrumbs
- 1/2 cup mixed nuts (almonds, walnuts, pecans), finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1/4 cup vegan butter, melted

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Arrange the butternut squash rounds on the prepared baking sheet. Brush each round with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
3. In a bowl, mix together the panko breadcrumbs, chopped nuts, nutritional yeast, smoked paprika, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper.
4. Add the melted vegan butter to the breadcrumb mixture, stirring until the mix is well coated.
5. Generously top each butternut squash round with the breadcrumb mixture, pressing slightly to adhere.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the squash is tender and the topping is golden and crisp.
7. Serve warm and enjoy!

Enjoy this heartwarming dish as a standalone star or as a complementary side to a more elaborate meal. Its bold flavors and textures are sure to make it a new favorite for the season.
