## Introduction

Inspired by the lavish array of seafood typically found in a seafood platter, this vegan version mimics the textures and flavors using plant-based ingredients. Dive into this special dish that captures the essence of a traditional seafood feast without any animal products.

## Ingredients

- 200g dehydrated watermelon, thinly sliced 
- 200g young jackfruit, shredded 
- 100g king oyster mushrooms, shredded 
- 2 tablespoons nori flakes 
- 1/4 cup tamari or soy sauce 
- 2 tablespoons maple syrup 
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar 
- 1 teaspoon liquid smoke 
- 2 tablespoons sesame oil 
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder 
- 1 teaspoon ginger powder 
- Fresh dill, chopped 
- Lemon wedges for serving

## Instructions

1. Prepare the watermelon by marinating it in a mixture of tamari, maple syrup, apple cider vinegar, and liquid smoke for at least 4 hours or overnight. 
2. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F). Bake the marinated watermelon slices until slightly dehydrated but still juicy, about 30 minutes. 
3. In a skillet, heat sesame oil, and sauté the shredded jackfruit and king oyster mushrooms with nori flakes, garlic powder, and ginger powder until they are browned and resemble the texture of crab and scallops. 
4. Assemble the platter by arranging the baked watermelon 'tuna', sautéed jackfruit 'crab', and mushroom 'scallops' on a serving dish. 
5. Garnish with chopped dill and serve with lemon wedges on the side.

Enjoy this delightful vegan seafood platter as a centerpiece for your next gathering or a special meal at home. It's sure to impress with its array of flavors and textures, proving that plant-based eating can be as luxurious and satisfying as any seafood dish.
