## Introduction

Unleash the excitement of flambéed gourmet with this unique vegan sandwich recipe. Crafted with a blend of aromatic flavors and a fiery touch, this sandwich promises to be a showstopper for any meal of the day.

## Ingredients

- 2 slices of artisanal bread (sourdough or ciabatta)
- 1/4 cup cashew mozzarella, sliced
- 1/2 avocado, thinly sliced
- 1 small tomato, sliced
- 1/4 red onion, thinly sliced
- 2 tablespoons vegan butter
- 2 tablespoons brandy or vegan whiskey
- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- A pinch of salt
- A pinch of black pepper
- Fresh arugula or spinach leaves
- Optional: a sprinkle of nutritional yeast or smoked paprika for extra flavor

## Instructions

1. Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat and add vegan butter.
2. Once the butter is melted, place the slices of bread in the pan, toasting one side until golden brown.
3. Flip one slice of bread, layer with cashew mozzarella, avocado, tomato, and red onion. Season with salt and pepper.
4. Place the other slice of bread on top, toasted side facing the ingredients.
5. Carefully pour brandy around the pan and allow it to warm up for a few seconds. Ignite the brandy with a long lighter to flambé. Let the flames subside naturally.
6. Press the sandwich slightly with a spatula and flip it carefully to toast the other side.
7. Remove the sandwich from the pan once both sides are crispy and golden.
8. Open the sandwich to add fresh arugula or spinach, and sprinkle nutritional yeast or smoked paprika if using.
9. Slice in half and serve warm.

Enjoy the delightful crunch and the warm, smoky flavors of this flambéed vegan sandwich. Ideal for a cozy lunch or a special dinner, this dish is sure to impress with its bold flavors and dramatic presentation.
