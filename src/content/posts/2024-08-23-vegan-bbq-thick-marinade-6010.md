## Introduction

Today's vegan BBQ marinade is a thick, flavor-packed concoction that's perfect for marinating your favorite plant-based proteins. This robust marinade will bring depths of smokiness and a tangy kick to dishes, making it an ideal choice for creating mouth-watering vegan BBQ meals.

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
- 1/4 cup soy sauce or tamari
- 1/4 cup tomato paste
- 3 tablespoons maple syrup
- 2 tablespoons liquid smoke
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon smoked paprika
- 2 teaspoons garlic powder
- 2 teaspoons onion powder
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional for extra heat)

## Instructions

1. In a medium bowl, whisk together the apple cider vinegar, soy sauce, tomato paste, maple syrup, and liquid smoke until well combined.
2. Add the olive oil, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, and cayenne pepper to the bowl. Whisk again until all the ingredients are fully integrated and the mixture is smooth.
3. Taste the marinade and adjust the seasoning or sweetness to your preference.
4. Use immediately, or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week.

This thick marinade is not only versatile but also stores well, so you can make a batch ahead of time and keep it in the fridge for up to a week. Use it to marinate seitan, tempeh, or even vegetables before grilling to infuse your vegan BBQ with an unforgettable flavor.
