## Introduction

Spice up your lunch with this vibrant and flavorful Vegan Spicy Arrabbiata Penne. This dish combines the heat of chili with the freshness of tomatoes and herbs, making it a perfect, zesty meal for those who enjoy a little kick in their palate.

## Ingredients

- 250g penne pasta (choose gluten-free if necessary)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 teaspoon red chili flakes (adjust according to taste)
- 400g canned whole tomatoes, crushed by hand
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- Salt to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper
- A handful of fresh basil, chopped
- Nutritional yeast (optional, for serving)

## Instructions

1. Cook the penne pasta according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.
2. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and chili flakes, saut√©ing until the garlic is fragrant and golden.
3. Add the crushed tomatoes, sugar, salt, and black pepper to the skillet. Simmer for about 10-15 minutes, or until the sauce thickens slightly.
4. Toss the cooked penne with the spicy tomato sauce. Mix well to ensure all the pasta is coated.
5. Stir in the chopped basil and remove from heat.
6. Serve hot, sprinkled with nutritional yeast if desired, for an extra flavor boost.

Enjoy this delightful blend of heat and comfort - a perfect spicy dish to break the monotony of your regular meals. Serve hot, garnished with fresh basil, and perhaps a side of crusty bread to complete the experience.
