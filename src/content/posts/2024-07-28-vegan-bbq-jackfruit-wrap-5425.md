## Introduction

Enjoy a light yet satisfying vegan BBQ wrap, perfect for a quick and healthy lunch. Packed with smoky BBQ jackfruit and fresh vegetables, it's a delightful twist on traditional BBQ flavors.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup young green jackfruit, canned and drained
- 1/2 cup vegan BBQ sauce
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1/2 red onion, thinly sliced
- 1/2 bell pepper, thinly sliced
- 2 whole wheat tortillas or vegan wraps
- 1/2 cup spinach leaves
- 1/4 cup vegan mayonnaise
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat.
2. Add the jackfruit and cook for 5-7 minutes until it starts to brown.
3. Pour in the BBQ sauce and cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the jackfruit is well coated and heated through.
4. In another pan, sauté the red onion and bell pepper until they are soft and slightly caramelized.
5. Warm the tortillas in a microwave or on a skillet for a few seconds to make them pliable.
6. Spread vegan mayonnaise on each tortilla.
7. Divide the spinach leaves, sautéed vegetables, and BBQ jackfruit evenly among the tortillas.

Serve this delicious vegan BBQ wrap with a side of homemade potato chips or a fresh garden salad for a complete meal. It's perfect for those who crave BBQ flavors in a portable, easy-to-make lunch option.
