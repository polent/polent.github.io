## Introduction

Today's grassy soup is a fresh, vibrant blend of flavors, perfect for a light lunch or a soothing dinner. This recipe brings together a variety of greens and herbs, creating a nutrient-packed dish that's as healthy as it is delicious.

## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 large onion, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup chopped leeks
- 1/2 cup chopped celery
- 1/2 cup chopped fennel bulb
- 1 large potato, peeled and diced
- 4 cups vegetable broth
- 2 cups spinach leaves
- 1 cup kale leaves, chopped
- 1/2 cup fresh parsley, chopped
- 1/4 cup fresh basil leaves, chopped
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Lemon juice, for serving

## Instructions

1. Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat.
2. Add the onion, garlic, leeks, celery, and fennel. Cook until vegetables are softened, about 5-7 minutes.
3. Stir in the diced potato and pour in the vegetable broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until the potato is tender, about 15 minutes.
4. Add the spinach, kale, parsley, and basil to the pot. Continue to simmer for another 5 minutes, or until the greens have wilted.
5. Remove from heat and use an immersion blender to puree the soup until smooth.
6. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot, with a squeeze of lemon juice.

Serve this comforting bowl of grassy soup with a side of crusty bread for dipping, and enjoy a meal that's both nourishing and satisfying.
