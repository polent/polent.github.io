## Ingredients

- 2 cups whole wheat flour
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 packet (2¼ tsp) active dry yeast
- 2 tbsp fresh rosemary, finely chopped
- 1 tbsp fresh thyme, finely chopped
- 1 tbsp fresh basil, finely chopped
- 1¼ cups warm water
- 2 tbsp olive oil

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, whisk together whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, sugar, and salt.
2. Sprinkle yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until foamy.
3. Add the foamy yeast mixture and olive oil to the dry ingredients. Stir until the dough begins to form.

8. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
