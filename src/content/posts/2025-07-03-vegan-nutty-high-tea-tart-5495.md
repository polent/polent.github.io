## Introduction

Welcome to a delightful twist on high tea with a dish that's not only nourishing but also brimming with unique flavors. This vegan nutty tart, inspired by the classic high tea ambiance, combines the crunchiness of mixed nuts with the sweetness of dates and a hint of salt, encased in a crispy tart shell made from almond flour.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup almond flour
- 1/4 cup coconut oil, melted
- 2 tablespoons maple syrup
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup mixed nuts (such as almonds, walnuts, and pecans), roughly chopped
- 1/2 cup dates, pitted and chopped
- 1/4 cup coconut cream
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. In a mixing bowl, combine almond flour, melted coconut oil, maple syrup, and a pinch of salt to form a dough.
3. Press the dough into a tart pan, creating a firm and even base.
4. Bake the crust for 10 minutes, or until slightly golden.
5. In a saucepan, combine the chopped nuts, dates, coconut cream, vanilla extract, and the remaining salt. Cook over medium heat until the mixture is well combined and sticky.
6. Pour the nut mixture into the pre-baked crust and spread evenly.
7. Return the tart to the oven and bake for an additional 15 minutes.
8. Allow the tart to cool before slicing and serving.

Enjoy this exquisite nutty tart as the perfect end to your high tea, pairing beautifully with a cup of herbal tea or a frothy cappuccino. It's a wonderful way to celebrate the day with elegance and a touch of sweetness.
