At the center, visualize a dish of marinated jackfruit, glowing with a fiery marinade and each fiber coated in spice, ready to be eaten. Surrounding that, depict slices of grilled seitan with a charred, rich, smoky taste. Also, illustrate an assortment of colorful marinated vegetables like bell peppers, zucchini, and mushrooms, all beautifully grilled and bursting with bold flavors. Adorn the table with fresh herbs and sprinkle the image with sesame seeds for a crunchy, nutty touch. Let it evoke the enticing smoky, spicy elements of the marinade promising a truly memorable vegan BBQ experience."
