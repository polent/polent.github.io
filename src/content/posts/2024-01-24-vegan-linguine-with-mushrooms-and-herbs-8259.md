  imageAlt: "Create an image of a peaceful lunch table set with styled elegance, on which there's a plate of vegan linguine. The pasta is filled with mushrooms and herbs, glazed by a creamy cashew sauce. Sautéed mushrooms introduce an earthy aspect to the meal. Herbs such as fresh parsley and thyme sprinkled on top provide a lively contrast of green. Besides the plate, wooden utensils lay on soft linens. There's a glass of lemon-infused water that serves as a refreshing side beverage. The scene is lit up by natural light coming in through a window, bathing the setting in a tender, welcoming glow."
