## Introduction

Welcome to the heart of Italian vegan cuisine! Tonight's simple yet delightful dinner is a plant-based twist on the classic Pasta alla Norma. This dish boasts the richness of roasted eggplant, tanginess of tomatoes, and creaminess of homemade vegan ricotta cheese.

## Ingredients

1. 200g spaghetti
2. 1 medium eggplant, cut into cubes
3. 2 cloves of garlic, minced
4. 400g canned diced tomatoes
5. 2 tablespoons olive oil
6. Salt and pepper to taste
7. Handful of fresh basil, chopped
8. 100g homemade vegan ricotta cheese
9. 1 teaspoon chili flakes (optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 200°C (390°F) and toss the eggplant cubes with 1 tablespoon olive oil, salt, and pepper. Spread on a baking sheet and roast for 20-25 minutes, until golden brown.
2. While the eggplant is roasting, cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions. Reserve some pasta water for later.
3. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a pan, add the minced garlic, and sauté until golden. Add the canned tomatoes, salt, pepper, and chili flakes if using. Let it simmer for about 10 minutes.
4. Once the eggplant is done, add it to the tomato sauce. Then, add the cooked spaghetti and some pasta water if needed, stirring until well combined.
5. Serve the pasta hot, topped with vegan ricotta cheese and fresh basil.
