## Introduction

Tonight's dinner is a delightful celebration of flavors and textures, perfect for a robust evening meal. Our Vegan Mushroom Wellington is a delectable centerpiece, wrapped in a flaky, golden crust and filled with a savory blend of mushrooms and lentils, enhanced with aromatic herbs.

## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 500g mixed mushrooms (such as portobello, shiitake, and cremini), finely chopped
- 1 cup cooked green lentils
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves
- 1 teaspoon fresh rosemary, chopped
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 1 sheet vegan puff pastry, thawed
- 1 tablespoon almond milk, for brushing
- 1 tablespoon sesame seeds, for garnish

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 200°C (390°F).
2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic, sauté until soft.
3. Add the mushrooms and cook until all their moisture has been released and they begin to brown.
4. Stir in the cooked lentils, soy sauce, thyme, and rosemary. Season with salt and pepper. Cook for an additional 5 minutes, then remove from heat and let cool.
5. Roll out the puff pastry on a lightly floured surface. Spread the mushroom and lentil mixture along the center of the pastry.
6. Fold the pastry over the filling, sealing the edges with a little water. Place seam-side down on a baking sheet.
7. Brush the top of the wellington with almond milk and sprinkle with sesame seeds.
8. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until the pastry is golden and puffed.
9. Let it cool for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.

Serve this Vegan Mushroom Wellington with a side of steamed green beans or a fresh salad for a complete, satisfying meal. It's sure to impress with its elegant presentation and rich, earthy flavors.
