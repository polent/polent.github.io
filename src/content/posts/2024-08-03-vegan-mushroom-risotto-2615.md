## Introduction

Tonight's dinner is a delightful twist on a classic Italian dish, perfect for a cozy evening. We're making Vegan Mushroom Risotto, a creamy, savory dish that captures the essence of Italian cooking without any animal products.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup Arborio rice
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 300 grams fresh mushrooms, sliced
- 4 cups vegetable broth, warm
- 1/2 cup white wine (optional)
- 1/4 cup nutritional yeast
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)
- Vegan parmesan (optional, for serving)

## Instructions

1. Heat the olive oil in a large pan over medium heat.
2. Add the chopped onion and garlic, saut√© until translucent.
3. Add the sliced mushrooms and cook until they are soft and browned.
4. Stir in the Arborio rice, making sure it is well-coated with the oil and toast it slightly for about 2 minutes.
5. Pour in the white wine if using, and let it simmer until it has almost evaporated.
6. Add the warm vegetable broth one ladle at a time, stirring continuously, allowing each ladle to be absorbed before adding the next.
7. Once all the broth has been incorporated and the rice is creamy and al dente, stir in the nutritional yeast and season with salt and pepper.
8. Serve hot, garnished with chopped parsley and vegan parmesan if desired.

Serve this warm, comforting risotto with a side of fresh greens or a vegan Caesar salad for a complete meal. Enjoy the rich flavors and creamy texture that make this dish a favorite in any vegan kitchen.
