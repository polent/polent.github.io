The centerpiece of the table is a plate filled with a vibrant mix of crumbled, slightly crisp tofu and colorful, tender vegetables, garnished with thinly sliced green onions and toasted sesame seeds. To complement this, there's a bowl of ripe berries and sliced tropical fruits, a few slices of toasted whole grain bread spread with plant-based butter, and a cup of freshly brewed coffee or herbal tea. Nearby, fresh flowers or a small potted plant enhance the scene. The image captures all these details from a slightly overhead angle, in soft, natural light."
