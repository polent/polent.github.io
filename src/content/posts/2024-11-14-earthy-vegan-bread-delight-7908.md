## Ingredients

- 2 cups whole wheat flour
- 1 tbsp active dry yeast
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 1/2 cups warm water
- 1/2 cup ground flax seeds
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 cup sunflower seeds
- 1/4 cup pumpkin seeds
- 1 tbsp dried rosemary

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, combine the yeast, sugar, and warm water. Let it sit for about 10 minutes until frothy.
2. Add the whole wheat flour, ground flax seeds, olive oil, and salt to the yeast mixture. Mix until a dough begins to form.
3. Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes or until smooth and elastic.
4. Place the dough in an oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for 1 hour or until doubled in size.
5. Punch down the dough and knead in sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and dried rosemary.
6. Shape the dough into a loaf and place it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
7. Cover and let it rise again for about 30 minutes.
8. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
9. Bake the bread for 35-40 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the loaf sounds hollow when tapped.
10. Remove from oven and let cool on a wire rack before slicing.

Enjoy this delightful dish alongside a fresh salad or a cup of warm soup to experience the full spectrum of its flavors. It’s perfect for those cozy days when you need a nourishing meal that satisfies the soul.
