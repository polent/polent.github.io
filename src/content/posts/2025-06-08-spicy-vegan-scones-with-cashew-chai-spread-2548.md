## Introduction

Embrace the warmth and spice of a unique high tea experience with this delightful Spicy Vegan Scone recipe. Infused with bold flavors and served with a rich, creamy cashew chai spread, this dish is designed to add a touch of luxury and spice to your afternoon.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 cup organic sugar
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/3 cup coconut oil, solid
- 3/4 cup almond milk
- 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
- 1/4 cup chopped candied ginger

**For the Cashew Chai Spread:**
- 1 cup raw cashews, soaked for 4 hours and drained
- 1/4 cup maple syrup
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
- 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, salt, sugar, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, and nutmeg.
3. Add the solid coconut oil and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work it into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
4. Mix the almond milk with apple cider vinegar and add to the flour mixture. Stir until just combined, then fold in the chopped candied ginger.
5. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead gently. Form into a round disk and cut into 8 wedges.
6. Place the scones on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 18-20 minutes, or until golden brown.
7. While the scones bake, prepare the cashew chai spread by blending all ingredients until smooth and creamy.
8. Serve the warm scones with a generous dollop of cashew chai spread.

Enjoy these spicy vegan scones fresh out of the oven for the ultimate high tea experience. Pair them with a cup of strong tea or a creamy latte for a perfect afternoon indulgence.
