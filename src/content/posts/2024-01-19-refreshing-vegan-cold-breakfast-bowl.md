  imageAlt: "Generate an image of a beautifully set breakfast table with a serene and natural backdrop. The centerpiece of the table should be a bowl filled with a vibrant mix of fresh berries and sliced bananas. The bowl is generously topped with crunchy granola, nutrient-rich chia seeds, and omega-3-packed flaxseeds. To give a distinct tropical flavor, the bowl should include some shredded coconut, chopped nuts, and a sprig of fresh mint leaves. A dollop of creamy plant-based yogurt completes the breakfast bowl. All these elements together should reflect a vegan, refreshing, and nutritious breakfast."
