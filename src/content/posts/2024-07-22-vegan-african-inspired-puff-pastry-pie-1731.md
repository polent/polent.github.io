## Introduction

Tonight's dinner showcases a delightful flaky creation, the Vegan African-Inspired Puff-Pastry Pie, filled with a savory mix of sweet potatoes, chickpeas, and a rich array of spices. This dish celebrates the essence of African flavors merged with the comfort of a flaky, buttery crust.

## Ingredients

- 1 package vegan puff pastry
- 2 large sweet potatoes, peeled and diced
- 1 can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 red bell pepper, diced
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 1 tsp cumin powder
- 1 tsp coriander powder
- 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
- 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (optional)
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh cilantro, chopped (for garnish)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 200°C (390°F).
2. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add onions and garlic, sauté until translucent.
3. Add the sweet potatoes, chickpeas, and bell pepper. Cook for about 10 minutes, until the sweet potatoes begin to soften.
4. Stir in the tomato paste, cumin, coriander, smoked paprika, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper. Cook for another 5 minutes.
5. Roll out the puff pastry on a floured surface. Transfer the vegetable mixture onto the center of the pastry, leaving enough edge to fold over.
6. Fold the edges of the pastry over the filling, slightly overlapping at the top. Brush the top with a little olive oil or vegan butter.
7. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden and flaky.
8. Garnish with fresh cilantro before serving.

Serve this golden, flaky pie fresh out of the oven for a satisfying dinner that's sure to impress. It pairs beautifully with a simple side salad or steamed greens for a complete meal.
