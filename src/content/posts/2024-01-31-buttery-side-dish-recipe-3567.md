Envisage vivid, glistening collard greens bathed in a luxurious vegan butter sauce arranged neatly on a plate. The serving plate sits on a clean, simplistic table, which allows the natural allure of the collard greens to thrive. There should be no text in the image, allowing the scene's appetizing colors and textures to communicate the dish's substance and appeal. The visual should encapsulate the essence of traditional African cuisine with a contemporary, plant-centric spin. Make the vegan buttered greens look irresistibly flavorful and rich."
