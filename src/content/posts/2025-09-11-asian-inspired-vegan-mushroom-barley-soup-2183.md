Introducing the Asian-Inspired Vegan Mushroom Barley Soup, a dish that's sure to become your new favorite comfort food.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup pearl barley
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 3 cups sliced mushrooms (shiitake, button, or a mix)

## Instructions

1. Rinse the barley under cold water until the water runs clear.
2. In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic, and sauté until the onions are translucent.
3. Add the mushrooms and ginger, and continue to sauté until the mushrooms are softened.
4. Stir in the barley and vegetable broth. Bring the mixture to a boil.
5. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, covered, for about 45 minutes, or until the barley is tender.
