  imageAlt: "Illustrate an appetizing scene of a homemade barbecue sauce table. Showcase a saucepan with a distinctive dark, glossy BBQ sauce crafted from ingredients like ketchup, apple cider vinegar, and maple syrup. Emphasize its smoky and tangy characteristic resulting from smoked paprika and a hint of Dijon mustard. To its side, place some of their contributing ingredients: a bottle of ketchup, a jar of apple cider vinegar, a container of maple syrup, and separate bowls of smoked paprika and Dijon mustard. Let the table have a bottle of the final sauce aside, and a lineup of vegan BBQ dishes like a jackfruit pulled 'pork' sandwich, marinated seitan, and grilled tempeh burgers, all tantalizingly dressed with the homemade BBQ sauce. Make the ambience feel like a plant-based BBQ feast is about to start."
