Crumbled tofu, slightly crispy in texture and a shade between white and yellow thanks to seasonings - soy sauce, turmeric, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and black salt. Beside it, a vibrant assortment of sautéed vegetables inclusive of bell peppers in assorted colors, onions, and mushrooms. The combination of the food's vibrant colors against the wooden table creates a harmonious and appealing scenery. For a finishing touch, the dish is garnished with fresh herbs and a sprinkle of salt and pepper."
