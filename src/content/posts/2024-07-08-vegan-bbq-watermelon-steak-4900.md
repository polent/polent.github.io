## Introduction

Tonight's dinner is all about bringing the comfort and zest of American BBQ into a light, watery dish perfect for a warm evening. Our Vegan BBQ Watermelon Steak captures the essence of traditional grilling with a fresh, innovative twist.

## Ingredients

- 1 large watermelon, cut into 1-inch thick steaks
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon smoked papara
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- 1/4 cup vegan BBQ sauce
- Fresh herbs (such as cilantro or parsley), for garnish

## Instructions

1. Preheat your grill to medium-high heat.
2. In a small bowl, mix olive oil, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper.
3. Brush each watermelon steak with the oil and spice mixture on both sides.
4. Place the watermelon steaks on the grill. Cook for about 5-6 minutes on each side or until grill marks appear and the watermelon is heated through.
5. Brush vegan BBQ sauce on each side and grill for an additional 1 minute per side to caramelize the sauce.
6. Remove from grill and allow to cool slightly before serving.
7. Garnish with fresh herbs and serve immediately.
