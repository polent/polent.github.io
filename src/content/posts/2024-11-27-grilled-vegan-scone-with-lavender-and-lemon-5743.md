This Grilled Vegan Scone with Lavender and Lemon is a delightful twist on traditional high tea fare, perfect for a cozy yet elegant gathering.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1/4 cup organic sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/3 cup cold vegan butter, cubed
- 1 tablespoon dried lavender flowers
- Zest of 1 lemon
- 3/4 cup almond milk
- 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Coconut oil for grilling

## Instructions

1. Preheat your grill to medium heat and lightly oil the grates with coconut oil.
2. In a small bowl, mix almond milk, apple cider vinegar, and vanilla extract. Set aside for 5 minutes to curdle.
3. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt. Add the lemon zest and lavender flowers.
4. Cut the cold vegan butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
5. Slowly add the almond milk mixture to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Do not overmix.
6. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and shape into a round disk about 1 inch thick.
7. Use a biscuit cutter to cut out scones and place them on the grill.
8. Grill scones for about 4-5 minutes on each side or until golden brown and cooked through.
9. Serve warm with vegan cream and a sprinkle of lemon zest.

Enjoy these delightful grilled vegan scones fresh off the grill with a cup of your favorite tea. The fusion of lavender and lemon with the smoky hint from the grill will make this high tea experience truly unforgettable. Perfect for a special afternoon indulgence!
