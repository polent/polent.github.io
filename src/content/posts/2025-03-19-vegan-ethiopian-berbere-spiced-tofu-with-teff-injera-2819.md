This recipe for Vegan Ethiopian Berbere Spiced Tofu with Teff Injera offers a delightful combination of spicy, aromatic flavors served on a traditional spongy flatbread.

## Ingredients

- 200g firm tofu, pressed and cubed 
- 2 tablespoons berbere spice mix 
- 1 tablespoon olive oil 
- 1 medium onion, finely diced 
- 2 cloves garlic, minced 
- 1 inch ginger, grated 
- 1 large tomato, diced
