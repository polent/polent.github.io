## Introduction

Today's recipe highlights a harmonious blend of East meets West in a vegan BBQ extravaganza. This Asian-inspired vegan brisket will tantalize your taste buds with its deep, smoky flavors and a hint of zesty Asian spices. Perfect for any occasion that calls for a special touch!

## Ingredients

- 2 pounds of seitan, sliced into brisket-like strips
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons hoisin sauce
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 inch piece of ginger, grated
- 1 tablespoon maple syrup
- 1 teaspoon Chinese five-spice
- 1 tablespoon liquid smoke
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon black pepper

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, mix soy sauce, hoisin sauce, sesame oil, minced garlic, grated ginger, maple syrup, Chinese five-spice, and liquid smoke.
2. Add the seitan strips to the marinade, ensuring each piece is well-coated. Cover and let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.
3. Preheat your grill or smoker to medium-high heat.
4. Remove seitan from the marinade and reserve the excess marinade for basting.
5. Brush the grill with vegetable oil to prevent sticking. Grill the seitan strips for 3-4 minutes on each side, basting occasionally with the reserved marinade, until charred and smoky.
6. Season with black pepper before serving.
7. Serve hot with your choice of vegan side dishes.
