## Introduction

Embrace the sweetness of brunch with this delightful African-inspired vegan pancake stack, infused with the rich flavors of coconut and cardamom. This dish not only captures the essence of a cozy, lazy morning but also brings a nutritious and exotic twist to your table.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 tbsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp ground cardamom
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 1 cup coconut milk
- 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- Coconut oil, for cooking
- Optional toppings: Maple syrup, sliced bananas, and toasted coconut flakes

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, cardamom, and sugar.
2. In another bowl, combine the coconut milk, apple cider vinegar, and vanilla extract.
3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined; avoid overmixing.
4. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and brush with coconut oil.
5. Pour 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake into the skillet. Cook until bubbles form on the surface, then flip and cook until golden brown on the other side.
6. Repeat with the remaining batter. Serve hot with your choice of toppings.

Serve these warm, fluffy pancakes with a drizzle of maple syrup and a side of fresh fruits for a brunch that's both satisfying and health-conscious. It's the perfect way to start your day with a taste of Africa!
