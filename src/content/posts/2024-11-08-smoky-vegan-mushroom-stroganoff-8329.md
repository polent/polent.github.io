## Introduction

Today's special from the woody food truck captures the essence of comfort and warmth with a vegan twist. Imagine a hearty, Smoky Vegan Mushroom Stroganoff, served over a bed of aromatic garlic-infused quinoa. This dish combines earthy mushrooms, creamy coconut milk, and a touch of smokiness to create a delightful meal that's both satisfying and nutritious.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup quinoa
- 2 cups vegetable broth
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 500g mushrooms, sliced
- 1 tablespoon smoked paprika
- 2 teaspoons dried thyme
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- 1 cup coconut milk
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
- Fresh parsley, chopped for garnish

## Instructions

1. Rinse the quinoa under cold water until the water runs clear.
2. In a medium saucepan, combine the quinoa and vegetable broth. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce the heat to low. Simmer for 15 minutes or until the quinoa is fluffy and all the broth is absorbed.
3. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic, and sauté until the onion is translucent.
4. Add the sliced mushrooms to the skillet and cook until they are browned and tender.
5. Stir in the smoked paprika, dried thyme, salt, and pepper. Cook for another minute to combine the flavors.
6. Pour in the coconut milk and soy sauce, bringing the mixture to a simmer. Let it cook for 5 minutes until the sauce thickens slightly.
7. Remove from heat and stir in the lemon juice.
8. Serve the mushroom stroganoff over the cooked quinoa, garnished with fresh parsley.

This Smoky Vegan Mushroom Stroganoff is perfect for a cozy meal, bringing the comfort of traditional cooking into a plant-based format. Enjoy the rich flavors and hearty textures of today's special—it's sure to become a new favorite!
