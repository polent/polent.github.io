## Introduction

Tonight's dinner is a vibrant, fruity twist on a classic vegan dish. Our Grilled Peach and Tofu Skewers with a Balsamic Glaze will delight your taste buds with its sweet and tangy flavors, perfect for a refreshing summer meal.

## Ingredients

- 2 large ripe peaches, cut into chunks
- 200g firm tofu, pressed and cut into cubes
- 1 red onion, cut into chunks
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh basil leaves for garnish
- **For the Balsamic Glaze:**
  - 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
  - 1 tablespoon maple syrup
  - 1 clove garlic, minced
  - 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard

## Instructions

1. In a small saucepan, combine the balsamic vinegar, maple syrup, minced garlic, and Dijon mustard. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until thickened, about 10 minutes. Set aside to cool.
2. Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. Thread the peach chunks, tofu, and red onion alternately onto skewers. Brush with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
3. Grill skewers for about 10 minutes, turning occasionally until the tofu is golden and peaches are slightly charred.
4. Drizzle the balsamic glaze over the skewers and garnish with fresh basil leaves before serving.

Serve these delicious skewers with a side of quinoa or a fresh green salad for a complete meal that's as nutritious as it is flavorful. Enjoy the essence of summer in every bite!
