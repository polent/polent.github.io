## Introduction

Embrace the cozy vibes of today with a heartwarming, syrupy comfort dish that blends sweetness with a touch of sophistication. Our Vegan Caramel Apple Risotto is not only a delightful twist on classic Italian cuisine but also a treat that warms the soul on any day.

## Ingredients

* 1 cup Arborio rice
* 3 cups almond milk, divided
* 1 large apple, peeled and diced
* 3 tablespoons vegan butter
* 1/4 cup brown sugar
* 1 teaspoon cinnamon
* 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 cup water
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* Chopped pecans for garnish (optional)

## Instructions

1. In a medium saucepan, melt the vegan butter over medium heat.
2. Add the diced apples and brown sugar, cooking until the apples are softened and caramelized, about 5-7 minutes.
3. Stir in cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt with the apple mixture.
4. Add the Arborio rice to the pan, stirring to coat the grains with the apple mixture.
5. Gradually add 2 cups of almond milk, 1/2 cup at a time, allowing the rice to absorb the liquid before adding more, stirring frequently.
6. Once the rice is nearly cooked, add the remaining 1 cup of almond milk along with the water and vanilla extract. Continue to cook until the rice is creamy and soft.
7. Serve hot, garnished with chopped pecans if desired.
