## Introduction

Tonight's dinner features a delectable vegan spin on the classic BBQ ribs, using hearty tempeh as the star ingredient. This dish captures the essence of traditional barbecue while being entirely plant-based, making it both comforting and exciting for a warm evening meal.

## Ingredients

- 1 package of tempeh (about 8 ounces)
- 1 cup vegan barbecue sauce
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
- 2 teaspoons smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat your grill or oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. Slice the tempeh into thin rib-like strips.
3. In a bowl, mix together the vegan barbecue sauce, olive oil, soy sauce, apple cider vinegar, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper.
4. Marinate the tempeh strips in the sauce mixture for at least 30 minutes, allowing the flavors to absorb.
5. Place the marinated tempeh strips on the grill or on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper if using an oven.
6. Grill or bake for 20-25 minutes, turning occasionally, until the tempeh is thoroughly cooked and has absorbed the barbecue flavors.
7. Brush the tempeh with additional barbecue sauce during the last few minutes of cooking for extra flavor.

Serve these savory vegan BBQ tempeh ribs with a side of your favorite grilled vegetables or a fresh green salad for a complete meal that's sure to satisfy any appetite. Enjoy the flavors of traditional BBQ with a compassionate, modern twist!
