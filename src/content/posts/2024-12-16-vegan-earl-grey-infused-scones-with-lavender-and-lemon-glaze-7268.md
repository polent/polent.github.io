## Introduction

In the spirit of today's candied high tea, this recipe merges the elegance of a traditional tea setting with the charm of vegan culinary delights. Introducing the Vegan Earl Grey Infused Scones with Lavender and Lemon Glaze - a perfect treat that combines the aromatic subtlety of Earl Grey tea with the floral notes of lavender and a zesty lemon finish.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/3 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup vegan butter, cold and cubed
- 3/4 cup almond milk
- 1 tablespoon Earl Grey tea leaves
- 1/4 cup dried lavender
- Zest of 1 lemon
- For the glaze:
  - 1 cup powdered sugar
  - 2 tablespoons lemon juice
  - 1 teaspoon lavender, finely chopped

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a small saucepan, heat the almond milk until it is just warm, then add the Earl Grey tea leaves. Remove from heat and let it steep for 5 minutes. Strain and set aside.
3. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar. Add the cold vegan butter and use a pastry blender to cut it into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
4. Stir in the lemon zest and dried lavender into the flour mixture.
5. Gradually add the infused almond milk to the dry ingredients, stirring until the dough just comes together.
6. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead just until it forms a soft dough. Flatten the dough into a round disc about 1 inch thick and cut into 8 wedges.
7. Place the scones on the prepared baking sheet and bake for about 20 minutes, or until golden brown.
8. While the scones are baking, prepare the glaze by mixing powdered sugar, lemon juice, and finely chopped lavender until smooth.
9. Once the scones are done, let them cool slightly before drizzling with the lemon lavender glaze.

Serve these delightful Vegan Earl Grey Infused Scones warm with a side of your favorite tea for a truly luxurious high tea experience. Whether for a special occasion or a lovely afternoon treat, these scones are sure to impress.
