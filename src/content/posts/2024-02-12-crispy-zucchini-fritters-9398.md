## Ingredients

- 2 medium zucchinis, grated
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup nutritional yeast
- 2 tablespoons flaxseed meal
- 3 tablespoons water
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- Vegetable oil, for frying

## Instructions

- Place the grated zucchini in a colander and sprinkle with salt. Let it sit for 10 minutes to draw out excess moisture. Squeeze out any remaining liquid from the zucchini.
- In a large mixing bowl, combine the grated zucchini, chopped onion, all-purpose flour, nutritional yeast, flaxseed meal, water, minced garlic, baking powder, salt, and black pepper. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly combined.
- Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
- Take a heaping tablespoon of the zucchini mixture and shape it into a patty. Gently place the patty into the hot oil and flatten it slightly with a spatula. Repeat with the remaining mixture, leaving some space between each fritter in the skillet.
- Cook the fritters for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until they turn golden brown and crispy. Transfer the cooked fritters to a paper towel-lined plate to absorb any excess oil.
- Serve the crispy zucchini fritters warm, garnished with fresh herbs if desired. Enjoy!

Enjoy these crispy zucchini fritters as a satisfying snack or appetizer, served with a side of tangy vegan aioli or a refreshing cucumber yogurt dip. They are also great as a party finger food or as a unique addition to a brunch spread. Get ready to savor the deliciousness of these vegan fritters!
