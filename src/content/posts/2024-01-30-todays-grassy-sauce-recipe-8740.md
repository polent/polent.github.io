  imageAlt: "Create a vibrant and detailed image of a vegan chef, who is of Middle-Eastern descent and female, in a contemporary kitchen preparing a bright green, fresh and flavorful grassy sauce. She has the following ingredients neatly lined up: fresh parsley, cilantro, mint, garlic cloves, a lemon, a bottle of olive oil, and small bowls containing salt and black pepper. She is using a blender to combine the ingredients into a smooth sauce, with the blender atop a counter, showing a swirling mix of green herbs and liquids. On one side, there's a clear jar waiting to contain the prepared sauce, and on the other side, there's a notebook with the nutrition facts per serving printed: 80 calories, 8g of total fat, 60mg of Sodium, 2g of Total Carbohydrate, and 1g of Protein. The preparation time is written as 10 minutes. The scene beautifully captures the chef's innovation, the freshness of the ingredients, and the enticing vibrancy of the sauce. There's a palpable sense of anticipation of the flavors this sauce will bring to dishes."
