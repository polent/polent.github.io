## Introduction

Tonight, let's enjoy a vegan twist on a classic BBQ favorite: Vegan Pulled Jackfruit Sandwiches. These sandwiches are packed with flavor and offer a satisfying texture similar to traditional pulled pork.

## Ingredients

- 2 cans (20 oz each) young green jackfruit in brine, drained and rinsed
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional for heat)
- 1 cup vegan BBQ sauce
- 4 vegan burger buns, toasted
- Pickles and extra BBQ sauce for serving

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).
2. Shred the jackfruit with your hands or a fork, removing the core and seeds if present.
3. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chopped onion and garlic, and sauté until onion is translucent.
4. Add the shredded jackfruit and spices (smoked paprika, cumin, black pepper, cayenne pepper) to the skillet. Stir well to combine.
5. Cook for about 5 minutes, then add the vegan BBQ sauce. Mix thoroughly to coat the jackfruit evenly.
6. Transfer the jackfruit mixture to a baking dish and spread into an even layer.
7. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the jackfruit is slightly crispy and browned.
8. Remove from oven and allow to cool slightly. Use two forks to pull the pieces apart to achieve a 'pulled' texture.
9. Serve the pulled jackfruit on toasted buns with pickles and a drizzle of extra BBQ sauce.

Serve these delicious Vegan Pulled Jackfruit Sandwiches with a side of coleslaw or your favorite BBQ sides for a complete meal. Enjoy the rich flavors and share the joy of plant-based eating!
