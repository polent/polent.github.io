## Introduction

Today's special is a delightful fusion of seasonal flavors and textures designed to warm your heart and tantalize your taste buds. This Vegan Pumpkin and Sage Crusted Pie marries the earthy sweetness of pumpkin with the aromatic richness of sage, encased in a flaky, golden crust.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour (plus extra for dusting)
- 1/2 cup cold vegan butter, cubed
- 1/4 cup ice water
- 2 cups pumpkin puree
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp fresh sage, chopped
- 1 tsp fresh rosemary, chopped
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1/4 cup unsweetened almond milk
- 1 tbsp nutritional yeast

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. In a large bowl, combine flour and a pinch of salt. Add the cubed vegan butter and use your fingers to blend until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
3. Gradually add ice water, stirring until the dough comes together. Wrap in cling film and chill for 30 minutes.
4. Heat olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Add onion and garlic, cooking until soft.
5. Add pumpkin puree, sage, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Cook for 5 minutes, then remove from heat.
6. On a floured surface, roll out the dough to fit a pie dish. Transfer to the dish and trim the edges.
7. Spoon the pumpkin mixture into the crust. Brush the edges with almond milk.
8. Bake for 35-40 minutes until the crust is golden brown.
9. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.

Serve this heartwarming pie with a side of fresh, tangy salad or simply enjoy it on its own. It's a perfect dish for a cozy evening, bringing a touch of culinary magic to your table.
