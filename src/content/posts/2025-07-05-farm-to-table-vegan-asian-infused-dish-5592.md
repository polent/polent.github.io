## Ingredients

- 1 cup of organic short-grain brown rice
- 2 cups of water
- 1 tbsp of coconut oil
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 small red bell pepper, diced
- 1 small yellow bell pepper, diced
- 1 zucchini, diced
- 1 carrot, sliced into thin rounds
- 1/2 cup of sliced mushrooms
- 1 tbsp of freshly grated ginger
- 1 tbsp of soy sauce
- 1 tbsp of sesame oil
- 1/4 cup of fresh cilantro, chopped
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Rinse the brown rice under cold water until the water runs clear. 
2. In a medium saucepan, bring the water to a boil. Add the rice, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 45 minutes or until the rice is tender. 
3. While the rice cooks, heat the coconut oil in a large skillet over medium heat. 
4. Add the onion and garlic, and sauté until they are soft and fragrant. 
5. Add both bell peppers, zucchini, carrot, and mushrooms to the skillet. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are just tender. 
6. Stir in the grated ginger, soy sauce, and sesame oil, cooking for an additional 2 minutes. 
7. Once the rice is cooked, fluff it with a fork and mix it into the skillet with the vegetables. 
8. Season with salt and pepper to taste. 
9. Garnish with fresh cilantro before serving.

Enjoy this delightful dish as a testament to the power of fresh ingredients and simple, thoughtful cooking. It's a perfect example of how farm-to-table cuisine can be both nourishing and exciting.
