This Vegan Peanut Stew with Millet brings together the nutty richness of peanuts, the heartiness of millet, and an array of spices and vegetables to warm your soul.

## Ingredients

* 1 cup millet, rinsed
* 3 cups vegetable broth
* 1 tablespoon coconut oil

## Instructions

1. In a large pot, bring the vegetable broth to a boil. Add the millet, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 20 minutes until cooked.

4. Stir in the tomato paste, then add water, bringing the mixture to a boil.
