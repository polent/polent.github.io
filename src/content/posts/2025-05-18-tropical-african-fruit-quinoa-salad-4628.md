## Introduction

Tonight's dinner is a vibrant celebration of fruity flavors, beautifully melded with African culinary traditions, tailored for a plant-based palate. Presenting the Tropical African Fruit Quinoa Salad—a dish that's not only visually appealing but also packed with nutrition and bursting with a variety of flavors.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup quinoa, rinsed
- 2 cups water
- 1 ripe mango, diced
- 1/2 cup pineapple, diced
- 1 large avocado, diced
- 1/4 cup red bell pepper, finely chopped
- 1/4 cup red onion, finely chopped
- 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
- Juice of 1 lime
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1/4 cup roasted cashews, chopped (optional for crunch)

## Instructions

1. In a medium saucepan, bring 2 cups of water to a boil. Add quinoa, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15-20 minutes until quinoa is fluffy and water is absorbed.
2. While the quinoa cooks, prepare the fruits and vegetables: dice the mango, pineapple, avocado, and chop the red bell pepper, red onion, and cilantro.
3. In a large bowl, combine the cooked quinoa with the diced mango, pineapple, avocado, red bell pepper, red onion, and fresh cilantro.
4. In a small bowl, whisk together lime juice, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Pour this dressing over the salad and toss gently to combine.
5. Garnish with roasted cashews if using, for added texture. Serve chilled or at room temperature.
