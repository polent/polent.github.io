## Introduction

Tonight's dinner brings a burst of Mediterranean flavors to your table with a simple yet sophisticated Vegan Artichoke and Spinach Risotto. This dish is perfect for a wholesome, comforting meal that doesn't skimp on taste.

## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup Arborio rice
- 1/2 cup dry white wine
- 3 cups vegetable broth, warmed
- 1 cup canned artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
- 2 cups fresh spinach, chopped
- 1/4 cup nutritional yeast
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)
- Vegan parmesan cheese (optional, for serving)

## Instructions

1. Heat the olive oil in a large pan over medium heat.
2. Add the chopped onion and saut√© until translucent, about 5 minutes.
3. Add the minced garlic and Arborio rice, stirring to coat the rice with oil.
4. Pour in the white wine and simmer until the liquid has almost evaporated.
5. Add the warmed vegetable broth one cup at a time, allowing each addition to be absorbed before adding the next.
6. Stir in the chopped artichoke hearts and spinach, cooking until the spinach wilts and the rice is creamy and al dente.
7. Mix in the nutritional yeast, and season with salt and pepper to taste.
8. Serve garnished with fresh parsley and vegan parmesan cheese, if desired.

Serve this creamy risotto with a side of fresh salad and a glass of your favorite white wine for a complete, delightful dining experience. Buon appetito!
