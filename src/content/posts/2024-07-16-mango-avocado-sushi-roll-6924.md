## Introduction

Delight your taste buds with this refreshing and vibrant Mango Avocado Sushi Roll, perfect for starting any meal on a fresh and light note. This dish combines the sweetness of ripe mango with the creaminess of avocado wrapped in sushi rice and nori, offering a tropical twist on the traditional sushi experience.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup sushi rice
- 1 1/4 cups water
- 2 tbsp rice vinegar
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 ripe mango, peeled and sliced into strips
- 1 ripe avocado, peeled and sliced into strips
- 4 sheets nori (seaweed)
- Soy sauce, for serving
- Pickled ginger, for serving
- Wasabi, for serving

## Instructions

1. Rinse the sushi rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Combine the rice and water in a rice cooker and cook according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. While the rice is cooking, mix the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl until the sugar dissolves.
3. Once the rice is cooked, transfer it to a large bowl and gently fold in the vinegar mixture. Allow the rice to cool to room temperature.
4. Place a sheet of nori on a bamboo sushi mat. With wet hands, spread about 1/4 of the rice evenly over the nori, leaving a small margin at the top.
5. Arrange a few strips of mango and avocado along the bottom edge of the rice.
6. Roll the sushi tightly using the bamboo mat, pressing down to compact the rice and filling as you roll. Seal the edge of the nori with a little water.
7. Repeat with the remaining ingredients to make 4 rolls.
8. Using a sharp knife, slice each roll into 6 equal pieces. Serve with soy sauce, pickled ginger, and wasabi.

Serve these delightful Mango Avocado Sushi Rolls as a fresh appetizer at your next dinner party or enjoy them as a light meal. They're sure to bring a burst of color and flavor to your table!
