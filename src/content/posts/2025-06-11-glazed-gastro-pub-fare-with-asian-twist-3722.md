## Ingredients

- 1 lb seitan, thinly sliced
- 2 tablespoons hoisin sauce
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon grated ginger
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1/2 teaspoon chili flakes
- 1 tablespoon maple syrup
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/4 cup sliced green onions
- 1 tablespoon sesame seeds
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. In a bowl, combine hoisin sauce, soy sauce, rice vinegar, garlic, ginger, sesame oil, chili flakes, and maple syrup to create the marinade.
2. Add the seitan slices to the marinade, ensuring each piece is well coated. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes.
3. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Remove the seitan from the marinade and cook until browned and crispy on both sides, about 3-4 minutes per side.
4. In the final minute of cooking, add the remaining marinade to the skillet, allowing the seitan to glaze beautifully.
5. Serve the glazed seitan garnished with sliced green onions and sesame seeds. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
