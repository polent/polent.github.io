## Introduction

Today's flaky lunch is a delicious Vegan Mushroom and Spinach Strudel, perfect for a light yet satisfying midday meal. This dish combines the earthy flavors of mushrooms with the freshness of spinach, all wrapped in a crispy, golden pastry.

## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 300 g cremini mushrooms, sliced
- 200 g fresh spinach
- 1 tsp dried thyme
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 2 tbsp nutritional yeast
- 1 pack vegan puff pastry, thawed
- 2 tbsp plant-based milk, for brushing

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F).
2. In a large pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic, sautéing until soft and translucent.
3. Add the mushrooms and cook until they start to release their juices.
4. Stir in the spinach and cook until wilted. Add thyme, salt, and pepper, and mix well.
5. Remove from heat and stir in the nutritional yeast.
6. Roll out the puff pastry on a lightly floured surface. Spread the mushroom and spinach mixture along one side of the pastry.
7. Roll the pastry over the filling to form a log. Seal the ends and brush with plant-based milk.
8. Place on a baking sheet and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until golden brown and flaky.
9. Let it cool slightly before slicing and serving.

Enjoy this delightful Vegan Mushroom and Spinach Strudel with a side of mixed greens or a tangy vinaigrette. It's not just a treat for your taste buds but also a visual feast that's sure to impress.
